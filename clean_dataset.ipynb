Can you honestly tell yourself, on a scale of 1 to 10, that you have a hunger level for God Beyond seven, less than seven? You are still playing. There is room to step up in. F fact, you get to a certain realm in the spirit where, if it is not at least 8 or 9, uh, there are certain things God cannot commit to you. Number two: your prayer life. Are we together? Some of us can wait for 7 hours in the office of someone, maybe a politician, and you are not tired. The man will come out in your presence. Ah, you are still here, sorry. Ah, no problem, Chief.

      "transcript [\"No matter how close you are to Destiny, if you don't finish, you will stay in the same group with those who did not start. You have come too far. Are we together? You've held a  plough ready for Harvest, in Ministry, in business, refuse to be distracted. The world is full of noise makers, naysayers, people full of pain- they may not be Wicked people, just wounded and Confused people hoping they can use your pain to find meaning to their lives.\", \"Let me tell you the truth: the greater your love for Jesus, something happens to you. The way you see men, your relationship with Jesus, directly affects how you see men. Listen, listen, listen. The Bible says: by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples. Not when you pray in tongues, not when you fast, not when you give, he says: when you have love one towards another, you can't say: your love for Jesus is waxing hotter and hotter and your hatred for those he died for is also waxing hotter and hotter. That is salt and fresh water mixing together. Is someone learning now, no matter what your background is, if you are encountering the Lord Jesus Christ and his love is growing stronger in your spirit, I tell you, the same compassion he had for men that made him to die will spill over through your spirit. It begins to affect the way you see men.\", \"No Nation can be built except by the value system of the Kingdom. No business can arise except by the value system of the Kingdom. Show me a man who is Born Again, filled with the Holy Ghost, and is beating his wife, beating his children. He may be saved, but you will never see heaven in that home because the values of the Kingdom has been compromised. So when you see things work, it is because the ordinances of Heaven have been important within that structure. Business books are full of spiritual principles that men claim to have discovered it by themselves and take credit for it. If it ever works, it is because it is God's principle. My prayer for you is that you will learn the ways of God and that you will use those ordinances to design a life that represents true Liberty, a life that represents victory. In the name of Jesus Christ,\", 'The house of God is a place of wisdom because of the presence of the word of God. The word of God represents the wisdom of God, documented and preserved for our learning and for our growing. The word of God is able to make any man Wise by teaching you the precepts of the Kingdom. The Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but fools despise knowledge and understanding. It plants within you the fear of the Lord and then it helps you to know the ways of God, and when you know the ways of God, your decisions become Superior, word compliant, better, consistent with the will of God. You secure the partnership of God to the degree to which you live in accordance to his will for your life. Why is the house of God the place of wisdom? Because of the presence of the spirit of wisdom.', 'I forbid you from living a fruitless Christian Life. I forbid you from living a Barren Christian Life where people consistently have to keep questioning: is it true that is the god of Heaven you serve? No, no, no. Even if you serve the devil, eventually there will be a semblance of results. I reject a powerless generation in the name of Jesus. Listen, let me tell you this. Results are very important for two reasons. Number one one: they act as consolations to your Christian experience. You have been taught that our Pursuit, uh, for God and for Spiritual things is not all about results. Our ultimate Pursuit is to know him, like Paul said, but but that in the dealings of God with men, there is a very unique consolation that results bring to people. You can serve God when you are poor, but you will serve God better when you are blessed. Is that true?', \"There is a law in the spirit: nothing happens without the participation of your will, and so Satan uses fear and makes you believe it's already done. So you agree with it and it happens. But even at that, you can reject it. When Jesus came to the grave of Lazarus, he said: if you were here, our brother Lazarus would have lived. But he said: even now, it is never too late with God. Even now, even now, this is what it means to be a  mature believer. You, you are not moved just by everything and you are not just making empty, bold face. Your confidence is resting upon the Integrity of God's character. You can't wake up in the morning. You, you live your life. Will I make it? No, come on now we talking about the character of God. If you do not know God, you will be a weak Christian, very weak Christian. The Audacity Of The Believer is derived from your knowledge of God.\", \"Do you know? There are people who beg and borrow for life. That's what they do. They beg and borrow. They wake up in the morning knowing today that if I don't beg I will go hungry. They were like that. They married like that wife keep begging while I beg too. Children, try your own friends too. Let's beg together. Now I'm not being sarcastic. This is a very serious issue, I'm sorry to say, but there are pastors who live like that too, and it's not a good thing. They are sincere people, but you see a life of begging and borrowing and poverty. It turns you, it misrepresents you and you get to a point where your words don't carry weight again. Imagine that I got up this morning and I kept moving from house to house, disturbing everyone. I know you, a rich man. Since you won that election you've not come to greet me. I prayed here in your presence. You saw me kneeling down every month on the uh, uh- what they call it- prayer request. And now you won your thing and just kept quiet like that. You've not even come to say God did it, and you know what it means by God did it.\", \"The spirit of delay. I want to rebuke that Spirit right now. This will affect many people. There are altars that speak delay. I told you that you know the spirit of delay is at work in your life, because the only thing that grows is your age. Every other thing does not grow. I want to pray for you right now. My God, I'm seeing light- light, not fire, resting on people, father, anyone under the sound of my voice, and every family, under the sound of my my voice, that has suffered delay. As you shout that name, Jesus, May that Spirit give way. Are you ready? One, 2, 3 shout Jesus. Delay goes now. Delay gives way now. Delay. I come against you, delay. I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\", \"You've heard my story. I told you from the time God called me. I already saw the vision of Nations. I already saw the visions of several people, but how many of you know that I still would have failed in Ministry even with that Vision, because when my time in Zaria was over, it was not part of the initial Vision. I saw where else I will go. Are you seeing it now? You can have the big picture, but every season demands you receiving a blueprint that guides you for that next level. Honestly, when I knew, I began to sense in my spirit, by this impulse of discernment, that in truth my season in Zaria had come to an end. But now, whether it was Abuja or it was J, or it was America or UK, because all of these impulses had been registered in my spirit that Koinonia would find expression in all these places. But which is which that one? I did not know. If God leads you, one of the way you will know he's leading you is he will never show you everything.\", \"This prayer is for gentlemen. Everyone can receive, but I'm praying for the men. There is a spirit that refuses to allow men to be established. The Bible says: let it be that after you have suffered a while that the Lord will establish you, he will settle you. I'm praying this. There are altars that have vowed that men in families will never be established. Educated but not established. Intelligent, but in the name of Jesus, any gentleman under the sound of my voice that has been tied down by this spirit that abots establishment, I decree and declare: be free now. Be free now. Be free now.\", 'I decree and declare, by the anointing of the holy spirit, that everything that is not of God over your life, around your life, in your life, let it give way this week.', \"God rewards The Works of men. He rewards diligent Pursuits, he rewards faithfulness, he rewards sacrifice. He rewards The Works of men. There are parameters for testing your work, and the Bible says in the realm of the spirit, if your work fails that parameter, there will not be a reward. I'm praying for you that you will not waste your time, dissipating energy, doing things that will have no rewards, and you have to know that by Understanding God's parameter for judging The Works of men, because the way God judges, he judges righteous judgments. He does not judge the way men judge. He doesn't look at the outer appearance. God rewards men, but there is a way you can go to God and say: Lord, you did not reward me. And he said no, no, no, no, no. I've given you your own portion, but you must know how to possess it and you must know how to contend in battle.\", 'Say in the name of Jesus, the of Jes, the spirit of greed of dies from my life. Shout it again. Say in the name of Jesus, name of Jesus, I conquer greed I conquer. I am a giver. I am a loving Giver, a happy Giver, a delightsome giver.', 'This is where Dominion lies: the ability to use what is written to superimpose. What was seen through Dominion is the ability to take what is written and change I saw. It is written is greater than I saw. It is written is greater than I heard. So if you see that I died, it may be true, but not when the scriptures have surrounded me like chariots. I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord. I choose life. Ghana is tempting me. What are you doing to me this morning? Hallelujah, praise God, ah, someone is angering your spirit, angering your spirit, angering your spirit for the many years of Lies, the many years of deception. No, let the redeemed of the Lord say so: you stand tall in your confidence.', \"Now I pray for you. The Lord is showing me chains. I want to minister to people whose Destinies have been tied down. Chains are a sign of bondage. You may not even know things don't just work in your life and you are wondering why. It seems you are tied down in the name of Jesus. I don't know where you are, but everyone under the sound of my voice, these chains that I see represent a TI down Destiny, a tie down family. Be released now. Be released now. Be released now. Be released now. Be released now in the name of Jesus. Businesses that have been tied down, lives that have been tied down, marriages tied down, families tied down. My God, fire is falling. I decree and declare: be released now. Be released now. Be released now. Be released now.\", \"What makes our works weighty, Mighty and of Great Value in the spirit number one: a pure and a sincere heart. Do you know why many people do not get rewarded over their works? Because for many, in the body of Christ, their work is I service. What makes your heart pure is the motive. If your goal for doing anything you are doing is self glorification and not to exalt Jesus, no matter how excellent your activity is, is been corrupted. May your robbing God his glory not deflate your success and bring you from grace to Grass. The second parameter that God uses to judge the works of men is your love for Jesus and your love for men. Do you know it is possible to love God and hate men? You are still a hypocrite. The Bible says: how do you claim to love God that you do not see, when you hate your brother that you can't see? The reason why many people claim to love Jesus is because they've not seen him.\", \"I'm praying for you. The wisdom component that converts toiling to profitable labor. May God release that wisdom upon you now. You will never SW in the wrong soil. You will never SW the wrong seeds. I pray for you again. You will never SW in a wrong soil and you will never sow the wrong seeds. In the name of Jesus, when favor is on you, donkeys will come to you, fish will bring coin to you. Everything in creation supports you because of what is on you. It says: Thou anointest my head with oil. He doesn't anoint your cup, he anoints your head. But you know what is on your head by what is on your cup. I pray for you. Every empty cup here, profitless cup that is showing that oil is dry on your head. May fresh oil rest on you now. May fresh oil rest upon you now.\", \"If you do not walk in love- love for God and love for people- there are things that will be there, but your eyes will not see it. Are we together? Yeah, hatred is like a Blinder. You can stand before an open door and be covered by hatred, be covered by jealousy, be covered by anger and not see anything. I choose to walk in love. I'm too young for high blood pressure. I choose to walk in love in the name of Jesus. I'm speaking to someone here. You have a book full of black uh list. You've been writing it in Primary School, Secondary School, University. Now in your place of work, you are a director, as childish as I'm saying this. You have it, whether on paper or in your mind. Tear that list now in the name of Jesus, lay it down and have peace for God's sake. Apostle, you don't know so, so and so person hurt me 1999. Have peace, my brother. You are the one who will be wounded. Love, everybody say. Say, love, love.\", \"Our works, our doings in the kingdom does not carry the same value in the spirit. The activities that were involved with spiritual activities and all kinds of activities with respect to Kingdom Come. They do not carry the same value in the spirit. You would think that everyone's work carries the same value in the spirit. No, it does not. The Bible tells us that the works of men are likened to Gold, to Silver, to Hay, to stubble. Talks about quality, talks about weight. There are certain works and certain Kingdom activities that the Bible considers as mighty works, the Bible considers as rewardable works. So, in the spirit, when God talks about Mighty Works, he's not necessarily talking about the Charisma, ISM around the work, but that those work have met certain parameters in the spirit that have made the works of great price, of Great Value, worthy of reward.\", 'If anointing was stored in a library or in a bank, some of us would not even have up to 10,000 W of anointing now because of the wickedness in the hearts of men. But thank God, there is he that anoints men, that we can cry before him and he can see the sincerity of our heart. And whether you believe the man or not, God decides and say: I have found David, my servant, and with my holy oil I have an anointed him. Ah, I have blessed and it cannot be cursed, cannot be cursed, cannot be caed..', \"So Judas? Not that he cared. I'm showing you a a pure heart now. If you were to look at Judas- I've taught it here- you would think Judas was such a compassionate person. My God, what kind of a well- mentored disciple is this? He should even be the head of the Apostles. All the rest were silent and this guy was thinking about the poor. But I like the word of God. It's a deser of the thoughts and the intents of the heart. That means, as you lift up voice to praise the Lord, as you do the things that you do, the word of God penetrates beyond your activity and searches what is the motivation behind what you are doing. Do you know why many people do not get rewarded over their works? Because for many in the body of Christ, I submit to you, their work is eye service, including their prayer, including their giving, including you. Remember, even prayer can be done from eye service. Jesus rebuked the scribes and the Pharisees. He says: you shout and pray in front of the temple so that people will see you, and so on, and so he really, really took time to rebuke them. There are people who like to do their activities before men. What should shine before men is not falsehood. What should shine before men is your good.\", \"Mentorship. A mentor is not a friend. Are we together? No, a mentor is one who challenges you till he brings out the best. Sir, just to let you know that I went for a meeting and, my God, I began to see a Grace manifest through me that I've never seen. I was calling out names and prophesying and someone rose up from the wheelchair and he says: wow, that's interesting. Okay, so that's all right, let's get to work. Are we together? There must be a benchmark that is high, high. Oh, sir, just to let you know, by the grace of God, I've been able to build my house, and he says: congratulations, but don't settle till the day you start building it as a seed in the house of God. Let's get to work. I'm praying for you in the name of Jesus. Everything that makes you settle over small results, I challenge it from your life. In Jesus name. Listen, I want to make a statement at the risk of sounding.\", 'If most Believers would do less of talking and more of prayer, they will Triumph. In experience, we talk a lot. As Believers, we have not been called to be noise makers in terms of speaking gibberish. The energy of the believer should be invested in building capacity.', 'He uphold it all that fall and raises up all those who are bowed down. So when you fail in business, when you fail in finances, while the mockers are mocking, I want you to know that there is a hand ready to pick you back up.', \"Many preachers who cannot see the more of God, greater power and greater glory. Not because prayer is missing, not because fasting is missing, not because Bible study is missing, not because giving is missing, not because intelligence is missing. What is missing is love. This is true for businessmen, this is true for preachers, this is true for people, you know, within family circles. This is true for people within an environment. I walk in love as a choice. I walk in love, you know. You know what lack of Love does- sorry to use this description. How many of you have seen a gutter that allows a passage for water being blocked by some debris and all kinds of things? You see that it short cires the potential. There are times that it can literally block the water and it stays there and it begins to stench and smell. Are we together that when you are passing, it can be so unpleasant? That is how bitterness and hatred. That's what it does to the flow of the anointing.\", 'The proof of Mastery is that you can teach without ambiguity anything you cannot explain. You have not gained Mastery over.', \"Let me tell you something I have learned about prayer. The first assignment of prayer is not to deliver results. You will be disappointed many times if what leads you to consistent prayer is a problem you want to solve. God can answer a prayer request somewhere in church, but when you submit yourself to prayer, the first thing that happens is not results. The first thing that happens is death. Are we together now that prayer begins to do something within you and God found something in men that he uses? The moment God sees that the delay in answer is keeping you prayerful, he will prolong it intentionally. That is the only way he can trap you. I know you won't believe what I'm saying, but it is true.\", \"Don't sell off his presence, you'll be defenseless. You'll be utterly defenseless. In those days when my wife's head was challenged, people had no opportunity to greet me. No opportunity. The environment is too charged. No pretenses, Revelation flowing like water. The Assurance was Stronger by the day. You can't survive without his presence. You and I are defenseless. Don't sell off that treasure with funny, funny things. No, someone say: have you ever been challenge? You ask challenge. When you been challenge asking me and him have been on a very jolly ride for a long time. You better wake up. What are you fac that others have not faced? It's Comm to commonize your challenge, otherwise it will overcome you.\", \"God rewards sacrifice. Let me tell you something about God. Every time there is Sacrifice, from the Earth to heaven, in fact, generally, the realm of the spirit does not ignore sacrifice. Let me take a moment and encourage someone. You have given your time, giv your resources, giving your all, in fact, serving the purposes of God. For some, it may be for many years and there may not be any obvious results. That looks like a consolation. Let me assure you, if it's the god of Heaven you have been serving in your lifetime, you will see your reward. Never find yourself mocking a Believer who is spending his life and is spending everything for God. You see, the serving God makes you look like a fool for a very long time, until he decides to come with his reward. He can visit you in a way that translates to your children's children for someone. God is speaking to you. You may not see the benefit of what you are doing now, but you are already paying the price for your children.\", \"God knows that I'm not just teaching you. God knows that I love you with all my heart. It's not only Jesus I love. Oh, I love you too. Ask him, Hallelujah. It is the reason why I keep pounding truth upon truth until you become tired, or otherwise, until you become insisting that you hear. The word of God is love. Are we together now? Yeah, some of you here you don't love at all. If the only person you love is your wife, you don't have the love of God at work in you. If the only only person you love is your husband, the only person you love is your children. If the only person you love is your destiny helper, you are not a spiritual man. This love must be shared abroad. Are we together now? Can you love people who don't have anything to add to you? There are people who their love is only controlled by value. It is hypocrisy. When it has to do with love, it must not be controlled by value. Reward is controlled by value, but love- genuine Bible love- is agape, is called unconditional.\", \"Imagine the Excellency of your spiritual life when you can import the possibilities of God and bring it to your family, your unb believing family that has mocked God before your face. And then, day one, they keep recording like a Secretary: Day One, healing. Day two, breakthrough. Day three, Deliverance. Day four, speed day five, restoration. At the end of it, they'll have to drop their pen and say: who is this God? Our evangelism is poor and we keep begging and moving around because, because every witness is not a valid witness until you have an Evidence. I have taught you this: that when you go to the court of law, your witness may not be strong until you present an Evidence. So Peter was standing before the Jerusalem Council making defense of his faith and the man who was crippled was standing next to him and the people could not dispute that Miracle. What evidence do you have that becomes a backing to all your speaking?\", \"There are many Christians who still walk in hatred and bitterness. You cannot become a spiritual man that way. Now let me tell you this: until you have a revelation of what Jesus did, it will be impossible for you to love men the way they are, because men are wicked. Are we together now? There are men who are almost unlovable, but not when you know what Jesus did for you. The secret to love is not just confessing it. The secret to love is a revelation of what Jesus went through, as a demonstration of the Father's Love For You. When you understand that, it empowers you to love even the unlovable, to know that even Faith Works by love and that anything that is not of faith is seen and that Faith Works by love. Here's what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians, chapter 13. It says: though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and I have not love. KJV says charity. He says I am nothing, though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels.\", \"The success that does not glorify God is useless success. The promotion that cannot glorify God is useless promotion. What does it mean for God to be glorified? I will tell you: God is only glorified to the degree to which Jesus is revealed through any growth, through any result. So the Bain in the spirit is: how is God's interest protected, defended and advanced? That is the Bain. It is a question you must answer if you want to do business with God. Lord, I'm trusting you to make me a billionaire. Fine and good. Here is the Bain again: how will the purposes of God be Advanced through the millions? How will the purposes of God find expression? Let me tell you the truth: it is a bain that if you cannot answer and you cannot step in to forget about doing business with God, I wait to.\", \"When you go through any kind of unfavorable season, always focus on the goodness of God. This is a big secret in my life. Don't focus on pain. Don't focus on stories. Don't focus on people, whether people who hurt you. Focus on the goodness of God. Something happens to you. When you begin to focus on the goodness of God, it has a therapeutic effect. It can heal you from Pain. Are we together now? I'm supposed to be promoted a director, but somebody played politics and they pushed me away. Every time you see that person who played politics, you will feel like someone give me a knife. You can't be living in that pain. The person is a director. You are the one suffering. Bitterness is like swallowing poison and watching in frustration why the other person is not dying. Men will be men. Wise men will remain wise till they change. Fools will remain fools till they change Med.\", \"Success is Not vague. Do not mystify success. You will never become successful that way. That success is measured across six areas. Number one: spirituality. The first area where we measure success for the believer is the extent of your spiritual vibrancy. Number two: very quickly. The second index for measuring success in the kingdom is your degree of transformation. When we talk about success in the Kingdom, it is not vague at all. There are six indices and none of them. None of them is unimportant and the Order of priority matters. Your spiritual health, the greatest index for measuring success. We're discussing the road map. I'm showing you a pathway that leads to ever increasing Glory.\", \"That you come from a family where no one has risen and you hear these arrogant, demonic people make statements like nobody will rise from your family. You don't need to start jumping. Let your result answer that there is a cur that has tied everybody in that family, that nobody will rise, no matter where they go to. You cannot argue with results and then you send the children of the harist to school on your scholarship and tell him this is a token of righteousness. Jesus sends Reign to the righteous and the unrighteous. Let your children go to school while we keep hoping for your own repentance.\", 'And people can know when you have learned to hide behind the cross to see the Lord glorified.

I'm led to speak to someone in the name of Jesus. You came here for your company, for your life. Honestly, God has led you thus far and the results are there to show. But you are right now at a prophetic Junction and you know that if God does not lead you, you can call Darkness light and call like darkness. And you know one thing with success is that one mistake can cancel out everything you have done. I'm praying for you because God LED them to a point where they Rod upon their high places. I decree and declare: May the God of all Grace lead you. May he Lead You by his word, may he Lead You by his Spirit. May he Lead You by the ministry of trusted voices. May the spirit of counsel walk through good men and speak the mind of God to you. In Jesus name, I pray.\", \"Are we together now? So this is what I mean. God rewards sacrifice for someone. God is speaking to you. You may not see the benefit of what you are doing now, but you are already paying the price for your children, your children's children. You are coming to church every day, paying your transport every day, loving Jesus every day, serving as a worker every day, and sometimes people will say: what is the benefit? I cannot see the benefit of serving God. You'll be patient and Watch What Happens. God will give you one child that will be like a, and when people say, how come your child is so exceptional, God will remind them that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him. You believe that? Say amen, amen, hallelujah. That's what he told Abraham. He said: walk thou before me. He says I will be your exceeding great reward. For a long time, Abraham did not seem to have any blessing and any consolation, as he desired. But when God visited him, he came with power. He came to him in a vision and he said: Abraham, fear not.\", \"Demonic appearances. People go to bed in the night and cannot sleep by morning. You think they've rested. It was a wrestle. This time is not Jacob's kind of wrestle- wrestle with demons, principalities and with one decree: like Jesus made over the sea, peace be still and an age long. Cal is restored in your family. They will start looking for names to explain the supernatural, like Pastor, like whatever it is, and they are right, because the Bible says they shall call you, me, Ministers of our god. Listen, ladies and gentlemen, from this night your life will begin to command extra ordinary results. I'm prophesying it to someone in the name of Jesus, the resurrected King. May your life command such phenomenal results. Please it, for as long as your life is not producing results, do not rest.\", \"To be humble and to be simple are two different things. You can be simple and proud. Just because you don't use an expensive phone does not mean you are humble. No, that is Simplicity, not humility. Are we together? Let me tell you what humility is. Humility is a state, a state where you perpetually acknowledge that outside of the help of God, you will not be able to attain whatever result that you have. It's a recogn that has an energy. It speaks that when people see you, though, you are confident. Are we together? You stand confident in what God has done in your life. Humility is not refusing to acknowledge what God has done. Filimon 1 ver6 says that the communication of your faith- are we together? Might be effectual through the acknowledging of every good thing that is in you, in Christ.

I declare that my God commands them to come on time. My God commands them to come on time. Some of them will meet them tomorrow. They will be waiting for you. They will bless you. You will know they were sent by God to help you. In the name of Jesus..', \"You will never become Victorious and you will never become great if you do not believe that it is in your destiny. Now the danger is that if all you pursue is Success, all you pursue is Victory, all you pursue is greatness as the end itself, you are already in trouble. Whoever swings to the other side of the pendulum and teaches you to ignore God. Just pursue success, success principles, just pursue greatness, and you alienate God from your life. You know the danger. You will be successful. You will be great as much as the Earth defines greatness, but because God is not a factor there and he's not your greatest priority, you would have brought to your life the things that will end up killing you. So after years of pieing together human laws that can bring success to you, you find out that you begin to die by the same tools you labor to bring to your life. I can tell you there is an element.\", \"Paul puts it beautifully. He says: I can do all things- arrogant statement. But then he says through Christ. If he had stopped, will say AB about Paul. You can do all things, but he says through Christ. You see, once you bring Jesus into the equation you are safe, but once you keep him out, it becomes Pride. It is true that God Has Lifted you. You are lifted, no matter how humble you are lifted. If you are rich, you are rich. Are we together? If you are poor, you can be rich, you know. But if you are rich, you are rich. If you are blessed, you are blessed. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so. Period. If God has helped you, he has helped you. It's not a lie. Are we together? If God Has Lifted you, he Has Lifted you. However you point men to him, you use that and point men to him. Pastor n puts it beautifully. He says: when you are done, take the glory. I am satisfied to just see you glorified that. That, that is one of the most concise capture of humility.\", \"Every dream here, every prophecy upon your life and every genuine expectation that has been delayed in this season. May my God bring it to pass. What else is God doing? We're almost there. God is still in the business of restoring joy and laughter. Joy and laughter. We're not playing with words. Joy and laughter, the Bible says a merry heart do it good like medicine. But a broken Spirit can dry up the bones.\", \"You will never rise if you try to fight it on your own. You are too small. You don't know how old these forces are. They are vicious in their operations, but not when the king of glory comes. He will arise in power with jealousy over you and say: what is stopping joy in this family? And they says: was some Covenant somewhere? Say no, do you believe I can step in? If you say yes, he said: now get out of the way. This is not your battle, this is there. There are battles you don't have the power to fight. My dear brothers and sisters, your assignment is to invite God into that situation and get out of the way. Do you believe that? So there are things men can do. There are things Satan does. When you see it, you will know. But there are things only God can do.\", \"You don't need everybody, you need the right people. Just one person, one, one, one.

They wake up in the morning knowing today that if I don't beg I will go hungry. They were like that. They married like that wife keep begging while I beg too. Children, try your own friends too. Let's beg together. Now I'm not being sarcastic. This is a very serious issue, I'm sorry to say, but there are pastors who live like that too, and it's not a good thing. There are sincere people, but you see a life of begging and borrowing and poverty. It turns you, it misrepresents you and you get to a point where your words don't carry weight again. Imagine that I got up this morning and I kept moving from house to house, disturbing everyone. I know you, a rich man. Since you won that election you've not come to greet me. I prayed here in your presence. You saw me kneeling down every month on the uh, uh- what they call it- prayer request. And now you won your thing and just kept quiet like that. You've not even come to say God did it, and you know what it means by God did it.\", 'Ible says in Acts, chap 4 and verse 33.

My God, I'm seeing light- light, not fire, resting on people, father, anyone under the sound of my voice, and every family under the sound of my voice that has suffered delay.

You're not just supposed to keep believing indefinitely till the day you die. A day should come when you handle, you lay hold on eternal life. You can handle the substance of spiritual reality. You can tell people that I once believed God. This was my journey, but today I can see the value of my prayer. The anointing has finally come to my life. Wisdom has finally come to my life. Favor is finally speaking in my life. I am making strategic progress spiritually and in life and destiny. Listen, let me tell you this. You will become frustrated, I guarantee you, if, after a prolonged period of time, your life and your Christian experience does not capture results, if it does not capture the faithfulness of God.\", \"There are many Christians who still walk in hatred and bitterness. You cannot become a spiritual man that way. Now let me tell you this: until you have a revelation of what Jesus did, it will be impossible for you to love men the way they are, because men are wicked. Are we together now? There are men who are almost unlovable, but not when you know what Jesus did for you. The secret to love is not just confessing it. The secret to love is a revelation of what Jesus went through, as a demonstration of the Father's Love For You. When you understand that, it empowers you to love even the unlovable, to know that even Faith Works by love and that anything that is not of faith is seen and that Faith Works by love. Here's what the Bible says in 1 Corinthians, chapter 13. It says: though I speak with tongues of men and of angels and I have not love. KJV says charity. He says I am nothing, though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels.\", \"Did you get the instruction? Now, if you are privileged to have your parents alive, I don't care whether you are happy with them or not- go and do something nice.

Sorry, forgive them on their behalf. I'm begging, go and do something. Are we together now? Don't be building hotels and building mansions and your parents are staying in in rags, rented apartment, embarrassing them up and down. If you don't have the means, that's all right. It was in the heart of David to build God a house, and God said: it's a good thing, even though your hand, your hand, has shed too much blood. He said: I will still not be offended. I will gather the materials and put it for Solomon. When Solomon was dedicating the temple in Jerusalem, he said: Lord,\", \"So people offered. There were people who decided to: oh yeah, let's do it. I remember it was a miracle service- head of protocol is here- when a woman from Lagos sent a Sienna and sent that Sienna and they dropped it and they called me that a woman had brought a car for me. I said God, who is this car for? And God said, no, this one is for you. I didn't look at that car, I passed. I went for for the miracle service. It was when I returned back in the night that I now looked at it. That's when I knew what had happened to me. The string that connects the heart with things was no longer there. This was the circumcision that God was doing.\", \"Like this, because someone has been crying saying: Lord, I have how long I have prayed, I have fasted, I have prayed, I have fasted while other people were jumping in the course of the conference. You've just been silent. God, speak to me. Here is your word. I want you to know it's not an attack. You are in a season where you are living in the Silence of God. You are planted. Give God time and be patient with your destiny. It will look like others have gone ahead of you, but in the business of of Destiny, you see, you don't compare yourself with someone who has gone, because when God is done with you, sometimes in one day he can bring 10 years in your life. So for that person we decree and declare the grace to wait, the grace to wait even when you don't understand what God is doing, the grace to not be distracted. May that Grace rest upon you now. In Jesus name, we pray.\", \"I pray for you in the name of Jesus, the grace for ease by the mercy of God. We have enjoyed this as a Ministry. I have enjoyed this in my life: extraordinary, inexplainable ease. May that Grace rest upon you now. May that Grace rest upon you now that results will happen at such a supernatural frequency. It will cause men to wonder and give glory to God. In the name of Jesus. Listen, for many, many people, what they call walk is toiling. For us in the Kingdom, work is creativity finding expression. There is a big difference. Toiling is a cost. Labor that is giving evidence to creativity comes with joy. Energy may be dissipated, but it's energy that has results to justify it. When results don't justify your dispensing of energy, it is called toiling.\", \"I want to teach you two scriptural ways to remedy the issue of time, two scriptural ways, and then we'll discuss one of them. Is God helping someone tonight? There are two ways that God helps a man who has wasted time. There are two ways God helps a man who has aborted time. There are two ways God helps a man whose Destiny is about to be ship wrecked because time seems to be against you. Are you ready? Number one: the first mystery that helps you to exalt dominion over time is called restoration- restoration. Number two: the second mystery is called speed. These are the two ways that God helps a man. Ah,\", \"Know the real gift God has given you. Find out what really stands you out and stay there.

You have seen it beautifully displayed in the life of someone and you wish you had it. There's no point wishing. When you check inwards, there is always something God has given you. When you see another person's garden- well, well, what they call it now- well watered, well, well manicured and fixed. Well, it is not by default. So when you see your bushes, scattered Garden, you is your responsibility to fix it to make it enviable. Are we together? Many people are about admiring the gifts of people.

I tell you I have a confession. You ask the protocol department and the security people. This is my fight with them. They are doing their job professionally, but if it's up to me, I will enter this place. You will not know if I have a way of just entering there to carry my Bible. Once it's time, I just appear here and preach and disappear. I will do it with joy. It's just that there are some levels in life, no matter what happens, there's nothing you can do about it. I know that while some of you watch all these things, some of you are admiring it and that's what drives you. Be careful. God is warning you now. God is warning you now. God is warning you now.

Are we together above the things that this world can offer, above jobs, above whatever it is? And it's a very accurate theology to teach Believers to  in their passion and their drive for God Beyond material things. If the scope of your seeking God is the end point of your seeking God is just to acquire things, then you have been misled. Are we together? You will get things, you will get all kinds of blessings, but that for any serious believer who is mentored properly. There are weightier and higher and more serious indices that measure success in the spirit, the greatest of them being your passion, your press, your drive for God, the depth and the extent.\", 'Some of you have not laughed this year. genuinely, you will see everything turning around, everything turn around, everything turning around.

Is that still in your Bible that ye are my disciples when you have love one towards another? Ladies and gentlemen, I just handed it tonight, by this teaching, the keys. These are things that I have lived by by the meres of God for many years, and it continues to schedule seasons of of power and ever increasing Glory. My desire is that this version of myself will die permanently and a newer one evolves with greater glory, greater wisdom and greater power. And so this sermon is even to me myself. The path is uncompromising. It doesn't matter who you are. It's the same path you will follow, setting your affection over the things of God that your heart is completely sold out to his purposes.\", \"Two major consequences of prayerlessness as far as God's program is concerned: it can abort the manifestation of God's program or it can abort the timing of that manifestation. That means God can desire that your family be liberated in January and because there's no intercessor, there's nobody with sufficient spiritual intelligence who can appropriate the victory of Christ over curses, yolks, territorial powers and take them at Bay to allow a free flow of God's program, you can find out that something that was ordained by God to happen in 2021 it will end up happening in 2032. Something that was supposed to happen in 1990 will end up happen in 2012. And you'll be wondering why that prolonged thing? Because it is the intensity of intercession, standing in the place of prayer to agree with God.\", \"Many spiritual men are not wanting in giving. Many spiritual men are not even wanting in surrender. They love God. Many spiritual men are not wanting in terms of the word, and all of that it is in this area of allowing the love of Christ to flow through them. It says the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the Koinonia, the sharing together, the participation of the Holy Spirit. It says to be with you all. Amen, hallelujah. I have taught you in this house that the, the singular description of God's nature is love. The Bible says it without missing words, that God is love, and if you are born of God, then it means you are also born out of a life of love. It then means anything that carries hate is not of God. The only thing we're supposed to hate is evil. The Bible says in Proverbs 3: 7. It says: be not wise in your own eyes, fear the lord and depart from evil. But then, when it has to do with your fellow human, no.\", \"I remember my destiny, I remember you, I remember the terms God gave me and it brings energy. Lord, I obtain Grace.

Let me tell you this: never stop prayer because you are sleepy. Now sleep, but don't stop prayer because you feel sleepy. There is a supply of strength that will eventually swallow up. Satan knows our bodily limitations, so he will tell you: you are, you are human. Now, don't get me wrong. There are times I sleep off. I remember one day I was praying. I nail down, I'm telling you, I knil down with seriousness. My Bible was, I was typing. I can't even remember that I stopped typing. I know I was. That's the last thing I remember. And it was not a vision, it was not anything. I just slept like deep sleep, kneeling down there.

These are like you know how you go to the hospital and they check your vitals. There are a few vitals that, once you check and you find out there's a problem, meet a doctor immediately. Not a medical doctor and not a witch doctor. A doctor meaning a teaching priest, a spiritual person who helps you. You see that among them, let me tell you this, you see this thing called gluton, gluton- an irresistible appetite for food. Now, food is good, don't get me wrong. I mentioned food. Now, some of you are not happy food. It is a great test of spirituality if you can tame your eating. Am I saying it's not good? Go and eat. What I'm saying the moment is something that you cannot resist. Number two: sleep, sleep, sleep as much as sleep is a very important thing. You need to be careful.

And let me tell you: if you're a person of Faith, you need to balance your understanding of Faith with this thing I just taught you. If not, you'll be frustrated. It is not every time God gives immediate answers, and it does not stop him from being God. There is profit in process and when God finds that in the life of a Believer, he will withhold answers intentionally to produce capacity and produce power. I remember praying, and weeks turned to months and I was praying and one day, as always, I was praying my usual prayer and the vision was open before me and I didn't hear anything. All I saw was the map of Abuja and I knew that was it. I remember rejoicing. I said: finally. Some of you would have said: God, so it's finally is now. Why did you now waste my time when I'm already in the Abuja? Always see what you have become before the answers came.

The devil attacking your prayer life is not just to get you to backslide, that's. That's too small a motivation for him to disturb you. No, he seeks to disconnect you from anything. Let me tell you this: Satan's obsession is to see that by any means he brings you to a point where your entire focus is on the three-dimensional realm, because he knows the moment. The consciousness of the realm Beyond here is there. Your Victory remains in intact thanks. Be to God. The Bible says, who had blessed us with all spiritual blessings where? In Heavenly places? But you don't need them there, so how do you transport them here forever? Oh, lord, your word is settled where, not on Earth. It's not settled on earth. Oh, is settled only in heaven.

The reason why we are on the frequency of ever increasing glory is because there is no room for the flesh to be glorified, from opening prayer until we share the Grace, from Sound of Revival to every school of ministry. Every, every activity in this ministry is directly tailored at revealing Jesus. I will gladly decrease, gladly, gladly decrease and Let Jesus be glorified.

You can come and stand and hold a mic and sing very beautifully, and yet in the realm of the spirit there is no singing going on there, because the person who is singing has an excellent voice, but it is not from a pure heart. What makes your heart pure is the motive. What is the goal for what you are doing? If your goal for doing anything you are doing is self glorification and not to exalt Jesus, no matter how excellent your activity is, is been corrupted. If there is anything I've leared about God, is that the sincerity of heart vetos the Excellency of any Kingdom activity. I don't care how exceptional the activity is. God will penetrate and move beyond the activity and check the sincerity of your motive.\", \"God rewards The Works of men. He rewards diligent Pursuits, he rewards faithfulness, he rewards sacrifice.

I'm praying for you that you will not waste your time, dissipating energy, doing things that will have no rewards, and you have to know that by Understanding God's parameter for judging The Works of men, because the way God judges, he judges righteous judgments. He does not judge the way men judge. He doesn't look at the outer appearance. God rewards men, but there is a way you can go to God and say: Lord, you did not reward me.

He will teach you to be used to his presence that if I have his presence, pres, without money, I am still successful. If I have his presence without a name, I am still successful. When his presence becomes your all, everything added to it does not distract you again. When God demands that you stay, he's not delaying your growth.

There are parents who get better and they don't know where the first born is. They don't know where the second born is. They know the Third born is in prison somewhere.\", \". Satan does not attack you every day. Know this. There are days that even if you call Satan to attack you, he will say: I'm not on duty, he's not a fool. Satan knows that there is something about the desperation of men. The desperation of men is his marketing strategy for this exchange. Listen carefully: for as long as you are a young person, having someone to sponsor you, taking care of you, it may be difficult to succumb to certain Temptations because there are Harvest over seed. You did not swow, so when Satan comes is easy to drive away that temptation. But the day you are now on your own and there's house rent, hello. And the price of foil is whatever it is. Now, in the midst of that desperation, Satan comes. The Bible calls him a thief, and only a foolish Thief steals all the time thieves don't steal all the time.

It's true, as as childish as what I'm teaching you is, it can change your life that because someone shook you in the morning, the accident that the person should have in the afternoon does not happen again. A lifegiving spirit. This is not you praying, this is you ministering life. If a flu can leave somebody to another person and that person did not even have to believe the flu can be transferred. It means Health can be transferred. If you don't believe this, then you are not a Christian. If I can transfer sickness, that Corona virus, hello. Because you are standing near someone and you look at the person and maybe you sneezed.

He said: I have many things to tell you, but ye cannot bear them now. Ye cannot bear them, not, ye cannot hear them. He cannot bear them. And I've taught you here that some of those things he wanted to say was what the spirit inspired Paul to write. You know how hard some of Paul's writings are, that even the disciples said K this one, ah, this man, this thing is hard, small. So imagine if Jesus were talking to them. They would be saying preach, preacher. And at the end of it they would say: let's go out fishing. This guy is talking nonsense and wasting our time here.

I forbid you from living a Barren Christian Life where people consistently have to keep questioning: is it true that is the god of Heaven you serve? No, no, no. Even if you serve the devil, eventually there will be a semblance of results. I reject a powerless generation in the name of Jesus. Listen, let me tell you this. Results are very important for two reasons. Number one: they act as consolations to your Christian experience. You have been taught that our Pursuit, uh, for God and for Spiritual things is not all about results. Our ultimate Pursuit is to know him, like Paul said, but but that in the dealings of God with men, there is a very unique consolation that results bring to people. You can serve God when you are poor, but you will serve God better when you are blessed. Is that?', \"If you have money, use the money to build relationships. If you have money and the only thing you have is a house and you say I have an estate, you will be surprised. Estates don't visit you when you in the sick bed. Estates don't say I love you.

So you need to understand that the person you are trying to lift, verify whether it is a demonic Interruption that is keeping the person there. It may be God keeping that person, because there are things to learn and you may hurry people into Seasons they are not matured for. It is a risk to obtain things without growth. That's why God programs seasons.\", \"Many people want to be great, but this thing called greatness is not a commodity that is sold on Earth. Ah, I'm telling you tonight, receive this impartations, so receive it, receive it. I'm telling you, open up your spirit and receive it. Our difference in life and Destiny is based on the function that rest on us. Stop struggling for nothing if that Grace is not there. It is not there. You can Lobby your way through the hearts of men and find out that you cannot have the attention. Oratory is good, but not enough. Eloquence is good, but not enough. Intellectual soundness is good, but not enough. There is a Grace that causes men to hear you. I pray for you again, the grace that makes great, that causes men to give you the gift of loyalty.

Many people are doing it, the idea of selling your soul. Most times when we hear we think it is something that you have to be occultic to say, okay, take my life and give me money. No, many people are already doing it. One of the ways you know through success is you find out what happens to your spiritual State as you rise. If you find out, you can know who is behind your success by looking at the consequence of that Rising on your spiritual life. The moment you find out that for every increase, every open door, every advancement, your spiritual life is suffering, you are transacting with Babylon, this demonic, satanic system. You may not know. Satan took Jesus up the mountain and he said: bow to me. That is how you sell your soul. You don't sell your soul by giving it. You sell your soul by bowing to something.

Those who look like they using their brain alone have not told you what they do when you are sleeping. Don't you D believe that the only thing they using is their brain? There is a threshold of results that when you see you, you know that the energy for that result was outsourced from a realm higher than this realm.

You see, but it doesn't just tell you the location, it keeps zooming and you, you keep finding out that it is helping you. Is that true? And there are times you go to a road and it is closed.

You see, let me warn you, walking with the Holy Spirit is usually not profitable when you start. So I warn you, so that sat, who is the master of the flesh, does not begal you into naming your submission to him a waste of your time. If it is God you are walking with, you will be a fool for a very long time before the wisdom behind his dealings with you is revealed.

Poverty all around your family and you fold your arms as if everything is all right. Is that the will of God?

These are the two major consequences of prayerlessness as far as God's program is concerned. It can abort the Manifest a of God's program or it can ab the timing of that manifestation. That means God can desire that your family be liberated in January and because there's no intercessor who can appropriate the victory of Christ over curses, yolks, territorial powers and take them at Bay to allow a free flow of God's program through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of Christ Jesus.

I have seen the video of a Crusher, metallic Crusher, that crushes cars, crushes objects, you know, and sometimes you will see a very great car, like a boss, split into two and they just put it and that machine will squeeze it and crush it and what comes out is not much. That's how the works of men are, so you can see something that looks over bloated, over bloated Ministry, over bloated life, over bloated whatever, but by the time it passes through the lens of God's system of judgment, only a handful of result comes out.

Grace is about to speak. You have paid the price bearing root downwards. It's time for you to Spring forth in the name of Jesus.\", \"There is always bread at the place of purpose. There is always bread at the place of purpose. The reason why many people do not get their allocation is that their heart is not right. There is always bread at the place of purpose. Listen to what I'm telling you. Always there is bread. If God tells you to go to Brook cherries, as mysterious as that instruction is, there will be a raven bringing you meat and bringing you bread. There will be Water by the Brook and when it dries up and you are still with a pure heart and and sincere love, you will hear him again and he will send you to zarth where you will meet a woman who will hold you there. It is impossible for God to call people and they are working in keeping with the blueprint he given them with sincerity of heart, and he leaves them as Beggars. It's a lie. Every time you see that anomaly, I submit to you. There has been a compromise on hearing patterns or obedience.\", 'Make sure the ministry of the word and the ministry of prayer never dies in your life. Create a system by grace and by discipline. God supplies the grace, but you supply the willingness. If you are not consistent in The Prayer Ministry as a Believer, you will not ascend to that stature of true spirituality. And if you are not given to the word of God, you are not given to study, you are not given to learning, you are not given to learning newer ways, greater ways of God, then you will be stunted in your growth. These two things I have learned in my own life. They have become secrets that will never fail. I have anchored them as pillars. You must pray every day consistently, every day consistently, by discipline. It is not always convenient- every day consistently.', 'It is dangerous. If and when, as a Believer, you do not bear fruit, you will become frustrated. I guarantee you, if, after a prolonged period of time, your life and your Christian experience does not capture results, if it does not capture the faithfulness of God, you will keep believing and consoling yourself. I hope you know it is dangerous if and when, as a Believer, you do not bear fruit. Hearing is our father glorified. When ye bear much fruit, so shall you be my disciple. So if your life fails to capture Victory eventually, if your life fails to capture Dominion eventually, if your life fails to capture Authority and power, you misrepresent God. It is a reason why there is a growing, there is a generation with growing hatred for anything God. They have not found a value in serving God. They have not found the value in praying, the value in giving the value in coming to church. To them it has become a burdensome ritual that they are tired of. And yet the Bible says: you can taste and see that the Lord is good.', \"There are people. If by 7 am in the morning you don't eat, it will be as if you are having headache. It's a spirit, I assure you. Even medically it's not even absolutely correct. The day you don't want to fast, you can stay even by 400 pm and forget. But the day you say I will Fast 7:30 and some of you will use TomTom or zobo to break that fast, is that normal? Is that what will satisfy your hunger? It's a spirit. Let me tell you the truth. There is no gift of fasting. Fasting, all kinds of fasting, take discipline. Let no one make you feel that there's an extra Grace. There is no record of any unusual Grace for fasting in the Bible. Fasting affects your spirit, soul and body. You will feel tired, you will feel the weight of hunger, but it takes you placing value. Who, for the joy that was set before him, endure?\", \"It is acting on the instruction that delivers the testimony, but the grace to do it or the determination to do it, if it be thou beat me, come. He said come. Only one person acted, and that was the only one person who walked on water. Fill six pots with oil, with water. And they filled it. And then he said: now fetch it and take it to the rulers. And as they went, water now turn to Wine. Knowing what God demands of you for his power to be delivered, does not make his power come through. He said: prophesied to these bones. Even though the bones were hearing the voice of the Holy Spirit, they did not move. But the Bible says: I prophesied as I was commanded. It was only then there was a sound, a rattling sound. Bone was now joined to its bone until it became an exceeding great Army. Tonight, instructions are going to come: prayer instructions, prophetic actions. I, like you, haven't heard this. Your faith now built. The grace and the anointing of the spirit is palpable in this place. The distance between you and your joy right now is obedience.\", 'My dear one. It is not about marriage and children. It is because he has sinen that. In it, Satan does not attack anything for itself, he verifies. Is there a component in your lifting? Oh, so you now become governor or you become head of Parliament, and in it, many people will receive scholarships to go to good schools and there is a chapel there. They will hear a man of God, they will be filled with the Holy Spirit. You will not win that election. He will fight you.', 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous. Even the righteous can be afflicted. But your Bible does not stop there. It says the Lord delivered him from them all. Let me repeat it again to, to speak, hope to someone. Many are the afflictions of this businessman. Many are the afflictions of a pastor, a prophet, a man of God. But the Bible says the Lord, even tonight, delivered him from them all. Some', \"Tonight God will step into your life in a way that everyone will know that this one is the doing of God. My Bible says it is the Lord's doing, and if it is true that it's the Lord's doing, it must be marvelous in our side.\", \"It doesn't matter how long it has been, provided it is speaking something else that it is not. Mercy is speaking something else that is not breakthrough, not Kingdom, not advancement. He must bow tonight. Are you ready to shout that name? Perhaps your father did not have the spiritual intelligence to W it off and he destroyed him. Anti marital spells, satanic manifestations, premature death, mysterious sicknesses: pray for you. It must give way at the count of three. Shout Jesus. 1, 2, 3. Shout Jesus, be released.\", \"Ins sufficiency is a curse. Let me repeat it so that you hear: lack and insufficiency is a curse. I'm saying it as a man of God. Lack and insufficiency is a curse, a curse that affects your mind, not your.\", 'That was dead and he that was a victim and he that was in tears Yesterday, When God Says arise, everything that is dead or dying must hear the word of the Lord. Arise from the dead may not mean physical death for you. It may mean arise from Financial death, arise from relational death, arise from spiritual death, any kind of death, in whatever form or fashion it has come to your life. I speak to you in the name of Jesus: arise, rise to a new level. I', \"There is something about the accuracy of your prayer that for every time you dissipate energy, there are results that justify it. Every time you receive Real Results, you become too grateful to be quiet. The greatest motivation for evangelism is personal results. Read your Bible: the mad man in gadara, the woman at the well. Every time people obtain genuine personal results, they were too grateful, even when they were instructed: don't tell anybody. How do I hide that God lifted me? How do I hide that I've entered another realm? How do I hide that the favor of God is upon me? Can that be hidden? Evangelism was designed by the intelligence of God to be a byproduct of consistent result. Your audacity in inviting people is based on your personal testimony. Come see a man who had told me. It's not a suggestion. I'm calling you with a guarantee: beginning from tonight will shift to another dimension of results.\"]\n",
