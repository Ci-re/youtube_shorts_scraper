The winner was selected by a vote of ACBC’s certified counselors. These titles have served countless biblical counselors this year as we aim to present one another mature in Christ with the power of His all-sufficient Word,.\\n\\nWinner: \\nA Call to Clarity: Critical Issues in Contemporary Biblical Counseling by Heath Lambert\\nThe contemporary biblical counseling movement is facing days of significant challenges. Many voices with confused misunderstandings of biblical truth are seeking to redefine biblical counseling. They are attempting to blur the clear lines between approaches to counseling care that are uniquely biblical and those that are fundamentally secular. Nothing less than the faithfulness of the biblical counseling movement is at stake. In these confusing days, the authors in this volume believe it is time to be clear about what is going on and what is at stake. A Call to Clarity evaluates the arguments of The New Integrationists, reaffirms key theological doctrines undergirding all faithful counseling, and calls all counselors to a vision of counseling care founded on the sufficiency of God’s Word.\\nSecond Place: \\nRedeeming Sex in Marriage: How the Gospel Rescues Sex, Transforms Marriage, and Reveals the Glory of God by Scott Mehl\\nDiscover the God-given nature of your sexuality and the magnitude of Christ’s power to redeem it in this honest, winsome resource for married couples. Biblical counselor and pastor Scott Mehl explores truths about God’s beautiful purposes for sex that will empower you to put godly sexuality into practice—living a life of sexual fulfillment and wholeness like never before.\\xa0\\nThird Place: \\nBiblical Counseling and Mental Disorder Diagnosis by Jenn Chenn\\nDr. Jenn Chen, a veteran psychologist turned biblical counselor, addresses the very relevant topic of mental disorder diagnosis and how to think about it biblically. She will help you to understand the DSM (The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), what some have incorrectly labeled “the bible” of mental health. Jenn demonstrates how the DSM is not as scientific as it is purported to be, nor is the process of diagnosing. While some in the biblical counseling world are seemingly moving toward the DSM, Jenn has removed herself from it and has accepted the Bible as her standard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAnnouncements and Events\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACBC seeks to provide resources, training and certification to promote excellence and doctrinal integrity in biblical counseling.', 'source': 'url'}\n",

Inspired by Dr. Bob Smith’s first edition, this book will help to guide counselors in offering specific reminders of gospel truth to counselees as they journey the road ahead.\\nThe first section offers guidance for the extra challenges inherent with certain medical diagnoses. The second section examines the challenges associated with a variety of physical and mental conditions such as autoimmune disorders, PTSD, Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, clinical depression, and more, helping counselors better understand the specific counseling needs that often accompany each condition.\\nSecond Place: Remade: Embracing Your Complete Identity in Christ by Paul Tautges. \\nDo you know who you are? Often our self-perception, even as Christians, is fragmented or incomplete―we struggle to grasp the richly faceted identity we’ve been given in Christ. When our evaluation of ourselves, our sin, and our circumstances is misaligned with God’s view, we don’t live with the comfort and motivation Christ offers. In this Scripture-saturated devotional, pastor and biblical counselor Paul Tautges provides 90 meditations on your complete identity before God in Christ. You are a saint in good standing before God, yet you are simultaneously a sinner who must battle with your desires and a sufferer who undergoes hardship. Day by day, discover how grasping this threefold biblical reality centers your thoughts and affections on the Savior and prepares you to stay on God’s good path as you live in a broken world.\\nThird Place: Wayward Children: Finding Peace, Keeping Hope by Stuart Scott.\\nTo parent a wayward or unbelieving child is one of the most difficult trials a Christian can face. Yet even if this is your experience, there is hope and comfort to be found in God’s Word and God’s character.

You yourself are the perfect Father’s child—let this devotional draw you to him, his wisdom, and his guidance every day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAnnouncements and Events\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nACBC seeks to provide resources, training and certification to promote excellence and doctrinal integrity in biblical counseling.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Lou Priolo, My Mentor and Friend', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Stuart Scott', 'question': 'A Tribute to Lou Priolo', 'body': 'I will begin with a regret. After a few funerals of my own family members, my mother leaned over and said, “Why do people say the most encouraging things about the person after they have died and not to them when they are living?” This statement has weighed heavy on my heart since she said it. I am working at doing better at thanking people and trying to encourage them while they are living and not just after they have died. \\xa0\\nThat’s my regret. I know I thanked Lou often (wherever our paths would cross). But I wish I had gone out of my way to say more to him about how much the Lord used him to impact my life and ministry.\\nI first met Lou back in 1988. I was pastoring a Bible church in Columbia, South Carolina. I was discouraged in ministry due to my lack of training in biblical counseling and the extreme disappointment of finding out what the various members of my church were getting as I referred them out to Christian Counselors.\\nI was invited to attend a one-week of biblical counseling training at Faith Baptist Church in Lafayette, Indiana. It was after that week, that I saw what I had been missing in my life and my ministry training. I had a thirst for so much more of the practical outworking of Scripture in my life, as well as those around me.\\nSoon after the Lafayette training, I found out about Lou and his counseling training classes on Thursday nights in Fayetteville, Georgia. I think Martha Peace had told me about this.\\nI remember wanting to learn as much as possible. So, for a year, I made the drive down to Atlanta on Thursday afternoons, sat in Lou’s classes, stayed with Martha and Sanky Peace at night and then Friday mornings sat in to observe Lou counsel. What a blessing!\\nThere were times that Lou and Kim would also have me over for dinner – an extra treat for sure. But with Lou, I had to work hard to listen well because he talked so fast as a New Yorker. In time, I was able to keep up.\\nMy wife, Zondra, was at the same time battling depression due to severe past events in her life growing up.\\xa0 So, I asked Martha and Lou if they would counsel her. What a wonderful change took place in her life and in her family’s lives due to the Lord working through Martha and Lou’s ministry to her.\\nA little later, I became one of Lou’s supervisees as a candidate to become National Association of Nouthetic Counselors (NANC) certified (ACBC now). So, Dr. Howard Eyrich supervised Lou to supervise me, to enable Lou to become a fellow with NANC at that time. Lou was such a help to me as I ran my questions by him concerning those I was counseling at my church.\\nEven later, Lou asked me to help part-time as a counselor at the Atlanta Biblical Counseling Center, which I did.\\nOne year, I remember asking Lou to come to Columbia to do a conference for our church. While he was in my office one day, he asked me what were all the notebooks that were on my shelves? I told him they were courses I had taken in various schools. He then asked me if I had a 1 Peter 3:7 notebook on Zondra. I had no idea what he was talking about. He introduced me to the subject of studying my wife to learn all about her, to live with her in an understanding way even more – I still have that notebook in my office and have encouraged other men to do the same.\\nEventually, I was asked to serve on Lou’s ordination committee. It was a delight to serve in that way and to see Lou set apart for the Gospel ministry.\\nLou’s knowledge and grasp of God’s Word was what I imagine Charles Spurgeon meant when he referred to John Bunyan, “Why, this man is a living Bible! Prick him anywhere—his blood is Bibline, the very essence of the Bible flows from him. He cannot speak without quoting a text, for his very soul is full of the Word of God. I commend his example to you, beloved.”\\nAll who knew Lou realized he could dialogue with you on various topics at 30,000 feet, but it wasn’t long till he would be asking or telling you how that topic could apply in your life at sea level. This is what I so appreciated about his writings as well, they were relevant topics in life but always “truth applied.”\\nLou was also a vision caster —for himself and in helping motivate others to think about ways God could work through them to the glory of God. \\xa0\\nLou remained a dear friend over the years. Although we didn’t keep in touch as much as we both probably wanted to, we would catch up a little when at conferences or we talked about a specific issue related to ACBC. \\xa0\\nLou modeled love and care to me, Zondra, my father-in-law, and to many, many others.\\nLike the words of the Apostle Paul in 2 Corinthians 6:10, “I am sorrowful yet always rejoicing.” We weep with those who are weeping, and we rejoice with Lou who is certainly rejoicing in the presence of the Lord Jesus.\\n\\n\\nFor free conference messages by Lou Priolo, see:\\nCounseling Lonely People\\nHelping Suspicious People\\nDanger Signs of an Unhealthy Dating Relationship\\nResolving In-Law Conflicts\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAnnouncements and Events\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStuart Scott is ACBC’s Director of Member Care\\xa0and Professor of Biblical Counseling at Bob Jones University and Seminary in Greenville, SC.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
      "{'title': 'ACBC’s Continued Commitment to Care', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'ACBC', 'question': 'ACBC is committed to certifying competent counselors who rightly minister biblical solutions to the problems people face.', 'body': 'A recent article posted on February 9 from Christianity Today criticized ACBC’s approach to counseling in cases of abuse. Understandably, we have received inquiries from our members and training centers that warrant a response. While we cannot speak to the veracity of every claim made in the article, we are able to clarify misunderstandings and recognize missteps that are not accurate representations of our Standards of Conduct in cases of abuse.\\nACBC’s Standards of Conduct state that, “Biblical counselors must care for counselees in protecting the weak from harm… Biblical counselors understand that it is impossible to protect the weak from every danger in a fallen world and yet they endeavor to protect counselees from exposure to the harmful treatment of others through false teaching, unbiblical counseling, harsh speech, abusive treatment, and any other manifestation of sinful relationships.”\\nACBC is committed to certifying competent counselors who rightly minister biblical solutions to the problems people face. We take complaints seriously and when certified counselors are in violation of our Standards of Doctrine or Standards of Conduct, ACBC is committed to addressing those errors with appropriate discipline in order to maintain our standards of membership.\\nWe have been preparing new documents for our counselors that will act as a clearer doctrinal foundation and a more extensive practical guideline for addressing issues of abuse. One reason for creating these documents is our desire to address any training gaps and offer more practical detail for abuse cases consistent with our Standards of Conduct. Counseling cases of abuse requires godly wisdom, discernment, compassion, humility, and boldness to present the spectrum of Christ’s care—confronting evil, protecting the vulnerable, and compassionately mending the wounded.\\nAny failures of ACBC counselors regarding the complex issues surrounding abuse demand that we grow in biblical wisdom and application for the sake of Christ’s name and the good of those affected by such evils. Regrettably, in some cases of abuse, churches have demonstrated an inadequate approach offering a mixture of insufficient counsel from the world and misapplied counsel from God’s Word. As an organization that seeks to reflect the heart of Christ in counseling care, protecting the vulnerable and holding perpetrators accountable must be a priority. ACBC counselors must respond with humility and repentance in so far as any have mishandled abuse situations so that they, and others, learn and grow from past sins and errors in judgment. Any misinterpretation or misapplication of the Scripture is due to a lack of wisdom in man and not any lack in the sufficiency of our Lord Jesus or the Word he has given to us.\\nGod’s good design of covenant marriage, with loving and Christ-like servant headship and submission, is a beautiful expression of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The evils of abuse do not portray the sacrificial love of Christ for His bride, rather those evils depict a different gospel—a false gospel. Biblical counselors are right to be zealous in their respect and honor of covenant marriage, but they also must have equal zeal in the correction of abusers and protection for victims of abuse for the sake of the gospel and purity of the church. This includes the freedom of conscience for victims of abuse to seek safety from dangerous situations.\\nWe recognize the appropriate biblical involvement of both church and government. ACBC counselors must follow mandatory reporting requirements to civil authorities so that the government may act in accordance with its God-ordained role. Churches are to implement compassionate Christ-like care for the abused, and discipline as a corrective measure for the abuser.\\nGrace and Peace,\\nT.

Adams edited by Donn Arms and Dave Swavely\\n“I didn’t hold back in declaring anything that was beneficial to you and in teaching you publicly and from house to house… I haven’t held back in declaring God’s whole counsel to you.” Acts 20:20, 27\\nThat testimony from the Apostle Paul is also that of Dr. Jay E. Adams, who has spent over 60 years teaching God’s “whole counsel” both publicly (preaching) and from house to house (counseling).\\nThis book contains essays by John MacArthur, Harry Reeder, Lou Priolo, and many other accomplished Christian leaders about how to do that kind of biblical ministry. The contributors are among the many preachers, teachers, counselors, and countless others who have appreciated Jay’s profound but always practical instruction from the Word.\\nJay’s landmark book\\xa0Competent to Counsel\\xa0was first published 50 years ago, and it was the first of over 100 books that he wrote.

      "{'title': 'How I Grew to Love Jay Adams', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Tim Pasma', 'question': 'If it had not been for the writings and teaching of Dr. Jay Adams, I don’t believe I would be in ministry today.', 'body': 'I have pastored the LaRue Baptist Church now for nearly 36 years. But if it had not been for the writings and teaching of Dr. Jay Adams, I don’t believe I would even be in ministry today. \\xa0And if you had told me\\xa0I’d be counseling people, not to mention training others to counsel, I wouldn’t believe you because the thought of sitting in an office counseling someone absolutely terrified me. Jay changed all that.\\nIndifference\\nMy first response to Jay was indifference. I had graduated from high school in 1973 and headed off to Cedarville University to study history. Of course, counseling was not even on my radar\\xa0but in my freshmen year Dr. Jay Adams came to Cedarville for the annual “Staley Lectureship Series.” I remember sitting in chapel “hearing” him (I can’t say I was actually listening), looking at my watch and wondering when this boring flood of words would end. I also recall how my friends and the faculty in the psychology department reacted. They were less than thrilled at his presentation. The discussions were interesting, but I wasn’t much interested in any of it.\\nWeird and On-the-Fringe\\nBy the time I left college in 1977 my views on Jay had changed. I thought he was a weird, “on-the-fringes” kind of guy. I had imbibed much of the integrationist thought that dominated Christian college campuses and the idea that the Bible was sufficient to deal with our deepest problems was \\xa0preposterous. “What kind of a nut would actually believe that?” I thought. I was also off to seminary, believing that the Lord might be leading me into pastoral ministry. My seminary education was good, but we only spent a week on counseling in the sole pastoral theology class required in the M.Div. curriculum. Someone may have referenced Jay in that class, but I don’t recall it. We all knew that if preaching didn’t get the job done you referred people to the “experts.”\\nI left seminary armed with my M.Div. and the idea that expository preaching would grow people and grow the church. As long as you spent forty hours in your office doing your exegesis and writing expository sermons, God would crown your efforts with success. After all, the big-name chapel speakers we heard in seminary built their churches that way.\\nDeep Respect\\nIn 1985, I arrived in LaRue, OH, ready to preach. But before long people started appearing at my office door needing help with their personal and marital problems! That wasn’t supposed to happen (not with the sermons they were hearing!). I found that even with four years of Christian college and four years of seminary, I didn’t have a clue as to how to help these struggling parishioners. What was I going to do? Within that first year I was at wit’s end and almost ready to quit. I was struggling.\\nBy God’s gracious and wonderful providence, I received a letter from my dear friend, Russ Park, a pastor with whom I had gone through college and seminary. He had been to a counseling training course at Faith Baptist Church in Lafayette, IN. He sent me a pamphlet explaining the course, I read through it, thinking, “This might just help me,” until I got to the very last page; a page displaying the picture of Jay Adams and his endorsement of the training course. “Oh no, not that nut!” I hesitated, but concluded, “Well, it might have a few things I could learn that would be helpful.”\\nI spent twelve Mondays traveling to Faith Baptist Church and, under the tutelage of Pastor Bill Goode, Dr. Bob Smith, Pastor Tim Turner, and Pastor Randy Patten, I learned the fundamentals of biblical counseling. But I learned more than that. I learned how to grow and change (for the first time!), what it meant to be a godly husband and father, and I learned how we ought to “do church.” All of this from the Scriptures. They are sufficient! A revolution occurred that summer that changed me and my family; and the ministry of LaRue Baptist would never be the same as we learned that God’s Word even addresses everything we do as a congregation.\\nAnd all of this happened because of an “instrument in the Redeemer’s hand,” by the name of Jay Adams. My mentors had been discipled by him. We read his books. The fascinating thing about it all was not that Jay and his disciples proposed a radically new paradigm for understanding and living, but that they pointed us to the Word of God. \\xa0I saw for the first time what had always been present in the Text! Rather than a book of problems (solve the problems and you’re ready to preach), Jay showed us a book of answers; a revelation from God that displayed Jesus “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”\\nI thanked God for His work that summer of 1986. I thanked Him for his faithful servant, Jay Adams. Jay had gone from “nut” to one of the men in my life, besides my own father, whom I deeply respected.\\nLove\\nFrom 1986 on, I tried to learn as much about biblical counseling as I could and that meant going every year to the annual conferences of ACBC (then known as NANC). In 1989, while attending the conference in Philadelphia, I happened upon my friend “Doc” Smith who was with Jay and so he introduced us. I actually got to shake his hand! Wow!\\nIn those days Jay would speak for three of the four plenary sessions in every conference. Each year I eagerly anticipated his addresses, amazed at the logic, biblical content, and ministerial application. I don’t believe I was ever disappointed and would go home more excited and better equipped for pastoral ministry. I was able to have some conversations with Jay over the years and got to know him a little more each time. I remember the annual conference where my friend, John Street, wrangled a lunch with him and we heard the story of how Competent to Counsel went from class syllabus to (explosive) book.\\nI came to love Jay when I saw, not the polemicist for and defender of sufficiency, but the pastor. What I saw and what I heard from him convinced me that he was, at heart, a shepherd. Although a scholar who spent many years in the academy, he thought all such study must produce pastors who could bind up the wounds, rescue and feed Christ’s sheep. One year he brought a number of folks from his congregation to the annual conference and I observed him interact with them. Obviously, you don’t see much in a three-day conference setting, but I remember how I was struck by the gentle care he displayed even in that limited situation.\\nIn the Spring of 2000, Jay came to LaRue Baptist Church to speak at our Annual Bible Conference. In those few days his humor, kindness and gentle, shepherding heart were on full display. After he would speak, we would gather for some dessert and coffee time in our fellowship hall. He sat in the midst of the “multitude,” conversing and having a great time. Everyone loved this guy! Thinking I would have some fun with him, I very publicly presented him with a mug emblazoned with “American Baptist Men.” His response was quick and priceless, “Thanks! I’ll use this at my next baptism.”\\nWhat particularly stands out to me, though, was the evening he came to our house for dinner. For most of that evening he conversed with our children and some of the young people from church; they were the center of his attention. He took an interest in them; he ministered to them. All those children are grown now, and they all remember that night.\\nI praise and thank God for Jay Adams. He is, without a doubt, one of the most significant figures of the twentieth century church. But my gratitude is more deeply rooted in the fact that God used Jay Adams to rescue a young pastor on the verge of quitting and then, using the Word of God, taught him how to shepherd the flock of Christ. “Great man” doesn’t do him justice. “Faithful servant” does.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAnnouncements and Events\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTim Pasma has ministered at LaRue Baptist Church, in LaRue, Ohio, since the spring of 1985.

I want to spend this time today doing exactly what Scripture calls us to do in Hebrews 13:7, “Remember your leaders, those who spoke the Word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.” I think it’s appropriate even on this week of Thanksgiving that we honor Jay, and that we demonstrate gratitude. There are a thousand ways that we can be thankful and grateful and one of the ways that Scripture tells us to be grateful is that we honor those who have passed the Word of God down to us.\\xa0\\nI can remember the first time that I met Jay Adams; it actually wasn’t by a handshake, it wasn’t even visually seeing him. I met him through his words. I met him as many of you have done through his books. I was a college student in my sophomore year at college and I remember sitting in my psychology class, Introduction to Psychology. I was fascinated. I was absolutely intrigued, but I was also a believer. \\nAs a believer who understood the Scriptures—I’m certainly not extra mature, I would say, but I knew Christ and I knew His Word—sitting in those classes, I just began to hear a very different narrative about who man is. Psychology had understood man to be something very different, but I was struggling to articulate this idea about why these ideas of psychology were wrong. I remember one time we were sitting down, at the time my girlfriend who is now my wife, we were sitting down having a conversation with her music teacher who was married to a pastor who we had become friends with. I began to share with him some of the struggles that I was having, how I could not articulate, I couldn’t express some of the struggles that I was having and learning the things that I was so intrigued about in the psychology course. As I began to talk to him that day, he said, “You know what? I’ve got somebody I think you should should read.” It was like he introduced me to this new friend, Jay Adams. \\nThe first book that he gave me was the Christian Counselor’s Manual. Obviously, this was the second book that Jay had written in 1973, his first being Competent to Counsel in 1970, and I remember just devouring that book. I was not a voracious reader even in college, but I remember that book began to give me life, it began to give me words. Jay had articulated the things that I was deeply concerned about. He began to use Scriptural language to help make sense of what was going on, and what I was experiencing in the things that I was learning and the things that were even quite intriguing. As I continued to read the Christian Counselor’s Manual, my world began to be exposed in how I understood Scripture and how I thought about Scripture and how I thought about people and how I thought about problems. Then, I next went to Competent to Counsel. I began to read Jay’s work and just an amazing work that God did with him.\\xa0\\nNow we have to understand that when Jay was writing, things were very different than they are today. You think about where we are today in the biblical counseling movement at large, so many organizations, praise the Lord for that, that are trying to promote ideas of biblical counseling, and Jay was helpful to start all of that. Praise the Lord for God’s grace and kindness through him, but you have got to remember during those days, it was very, very, very different. Many have called Jay a Luther-like figure where he’s calling us back to the sufficiency of Scripture in pastoral ministry and pastoral theology. He’s recognizing what was happening in the culture at large in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s. I wish we had time to go into the depth of history, because it would make you appreciate Jay all the more when you see how pastoral counseling had taken a completely divergent shift away from Scripture, a shift where we use Scripture as token, sort of overlaying, as icing on the cake. \\nAs we allowed psychology and all of its pursuits and observations to completely redefine man, who he is, and what we ought to be pursuing, what inaugurated is this new version of the modern self. This new version of the pursuit of the therapeutic. What many have called even the therapeutic gospel. As this is raging for three, four, even five decades in its infancy, enter Jay Adams in the 1960s. As he began to teach at Westminster Theological Seminary, and he began to see his task in teaching pastoral theology, he begins to recognize all the things that were going on and all the ways that pastors were pursuing faulty, unscriptural means in how they would shepherd their people.\\nI would say that the Lord gave such grace to Jay Adams. Here’s the thing—I’m not saying that Jay Adams was perfect. The history books will recognize that all of us who attempt to lead the biblical counseling movement, or really any movement, that we are all completely and radically insufficient. What we can say is that Jay saw something by the grace of God that was helpful where it was very, very dark in relation to pastoral theology, in relation to the way we thought about counseling, in relation to the way we think about human problems. The Lord gave Jay a grace from the Scriptures, I think by the Spirit, and helped us to see maybe the error of our ways, the things that we were adopting, the philosophies and empty deceptions that we were pursuing that we thought were an improvement upon Scripture and upon the work of the Holy Spirit. \\nJay called us back to the sufficiency of the Word. He called us back to trust in the power of the Holy Spirit. He called us back to a primary aim in pursuing sanctification as a primary means of true healing, true hope, true help. Now, we have to understand that one man couldn’t do all the work that was necessary, but praise the Lord by one man over 100 books Jay wrote on various subjects—homiletics, preaching, those sorts of things—but also in the realm of counseling. We are the beneficiaries of this treasure trove of works. I want to encourage you even during these days to go back to read some of Jays works.\\xa0\\nOne of the things that I find is so many people are critical of Jay, and I’m sure that there are issues at which we could all be very critical. I could start with the distinction between Jay and myself on what we believe to be true about church polity in relation to presbyterianism, and I’m a Baptist. We had our disagreements, that’s certainly true, but I think oftentimes some of those criticisms continue and are fostered partly because people have not read Jay for themselves. There’s so much criticisms about what he did or didn’t say. Can I just encourage you to go back and read? \\nI know that you will be encouraged, you will be sharpened, whether you fully agree with all the things that he says or not. I think what it will do is make you appreciate the voice that he used to cry out in a very dark time in relation to pastoral work and pastoral counseling, because in those days all of that type of soul care work was being shipped out and farmed outside of the church. Today, we look around and we see what a tremendous blessing where there was one primary voice who was crying out, today, we see an amazing movement that is not just encompassing the U.S. that we see happening with the growth of an organization like ACBC, but other organizations that we see growing, and not just here in the U.S. We are seeing an absolute tremendous growth around the world, because one man was faithful. One man was faithful to go against the tide, and to recognize the depth of the Scripture, recognize what the Scripture speaks to, and to plow through all of the secular philosophy to get back to Scripture, to call us back to the practice of Scripture. So I want to encourage you to go back and to read Jay, I think it’s so important.\\xa0\\nNow most recently, I had the opportunity for my whole family to visit in Horry, South Carolina. This is the place which Jay and his family have lived for many, many years. This is just outside of Greenville, and we visited a couple of years ago. We stayed even on their property, and my whole family had an opportunity to meet Dr. Adams, to meet his dear wife Betty Jane, and some of his immediate family. What an encouragement, what a blessing to be able to meet Dr. Adams, to have conversation with him. That wasn’t that long ago where we had an opportunity, I had an opportunity to sit down with him, he was very sharp still, had an opportunity to ask him questions. I love history, I enjoy history, and I wanted to know a little bit more even about the biblical counseling movement. I had an opportunity to sit down with him, and the Lord gave him opportunity to be fresh that night. Friday night we sat down for many hours. Then, all day Saturday we had conversation, and it was just an unbelievable time. It was such an encouragement, even to my wife as she spent time with Miss Betty Jane and the demonstration of hospitality and kindness even toward our kids. \\nI can remember one distinct moment: I mean, Jay and I were in this, you know, really adult, personal conversation about some of the intricacies of the history of the biblical counseling movement, and we’re in deep thought. I have two little twin girls who at the time we’re just over three, and I remember Jay pausing, because my twin girls had moved over to where we were conversing, and he pauses. Again, we were in the middle of a very important conversation, at least in my world, and I immediately thought as a dad, “Oh my gosh, girls, don’t bother Dr. Adams. Leave him alone.” He paused, and he looked at me, and he said, “I’m sorry, please excuse me. I have something very important to take care of.” I’m not thinking he’s going to deal with my girls, but my girls had made their way over, and had started to ask him a question. He paused to look at my girls, to be attentive to them, to pay attention to what they had to say. I love the way that they cared even for my children. It demonstrated to me the power of Christ in a person, and the love and gentleness and kindness even in an older age to show hospitality.\\nThat was a very special moment to me and my family where we had an insight into getting to know Dr. Adams and his wonderful family. Even more recently, this year, September the 11th, we had planned an event where many of us in the biblical counseling movement were going to go to Greenville, South Carolina and celebrate the 50-year anniversary of Dr. Adams’ work Competent to Counsel. This year 2020 marks 50 years; the book was written in 1970. What an amazing thing that God has allowed that book to still remain for all these years. We were intending to go on that day and to celebrate. Well, with COVID only a few of us were able to attend. With about six or seven, maybe eight people in the room in their home, we had an opportunity. Donn Arms, many from Mid-America who now house Jay’s library and who are republishing many of Jay’s books, were able to sit in the room and to talk with Jay and to celebrate this 50 year anniversary.\\nAs another point of intention we all shared about how we were introduced to Jay and the ways in which he had influenced us. It was just a glorious time of honoring a faithful servant. As was accustomed to Dr. Adams, he was very deferential to the grace and kindness of the Lord Jesus. At that time Donn Arms, who was a long-time faithful friend of Dr. Adams, had gotten several of us guys together to write a tribute to Jay. This has been a project in the making for about two years — a festschrift. A festschrift is a German word that just simply means “essays in honor of;” we were writing essays in honor of Dr. Adams to present to him on this 50 year anniversary. We had the opportunity to do that, and what a special time as we went around the room to talk about Dr. Adams, and his kind and faithfulness to the Lord, his consistency with the Scripture. The Scripture tells us to remember and to honor those leaders who taught us the Word of God. Again, I want to reiterate, I’m not saying that Jay was perfect, certainly not, but there are several things that I think we should emulate when it comes to Dr. Adams. \\nHere’s one of the things that I think is most important. If one thing could be said about Jay Adams it’s that whatever he was convinced of in the Scripture, whatever he believed God to teach in the Scripture, he attempted with all of his effort to live that out faithfully. If one thing could be said about us, I pray that that would be true, because with Dr. Adams, if you could convince him that Scripture said something differently, it would change the way that he acted. It would change the way that he wrote. It would change the way that he taught. It would change the way that he interacted with people. \\nWould that be said of us? That what flows out of us is what we are fully convinced the Scripture to teach or even now when we find ourselves 50 years after the inauguration of the “biblical counseling movement” through Confident to Counsel? Are we still wrestling with some other issues? Are we asking the question does the Bible really say certain things? Are we finding ourselves maybe drifting away from conviction of Scripture and striving with all that we have to live out the Scripture? Maybe we should take this moment, all of us, me included, to pause, to ask ourselves this question, “Are we pursuing Scripture?” As we pursue Scripture as our primary posture, are we striving with all of our might to live that out? I pray that would be said about me. I pray that would be said about me in the same way that it said about Dr. Adams, that whatever he believed the Scripture to teach, he taught. Whatever he believed the Scripture to teach, he attempted to live. What a thing to honor. What a means to be grateful for.\\xa0\\nSo, I pray that you will be able to pause even during this time of Thanksgiving. I want you to remember Miss Betty Jane, his dear and faithful wife of many, many years who served him faithfully. I want you to remember and pray for them, pray for the Adams’ family, but I also want you to remember the testimony of Jay. A man who is just like you and I, flawed, certainly true, but who passionately pursued Christ, and that we would imitate him in that way, and that we would honor him, because of the way in which he taught us the Word of God, that the Lord used his work to help open many of our eyes by the power of the Word.\\nI would encourage you as well to maybe pick up that book. The Whole Counsel, is what it’s called, The Public and Private Ministries of the Word. This was the festschrift that we wrote in honor of Dr. Jay Adams, and I think it quite appropriate that we were able to present that to him even before he entered the presence of the Lord. So, I want to encourage you to pick up that book, to take a few minutes even to pause, to think about, maybe reconsider some of the works of Dr. Jay Adams. I think you will find them encouraging, maybe even convicting, as you continue to progress in the way that you think about the Scriptures, the way that you think about people, and the way that we strive with all of our might to help those who are broken.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAnnouncements and Events\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

He was my professor of counseling in seminary in 1987 and then my mentor as we worked together in IBCD (formerly CCEF) starting in 1994 (2 Tim. 2:2). \\xa0George asked me to take over as Director of IBCD in 2006.\\nGeorge was completely committed to the supremacy of God’s Word in all things, especially in counseling (2 Tim. 3:16-17).\\nGeorge was completely committed to the church as the focal point of Christ’s work on earth as demonstrated both by his own participation in his church and the instruction he gave his students (1 Tim. 3:15).\\nGeorge was totally and radically sold out to Christ as a disciple. This commitment is shared by Eileen. They generously opened their home to those in need – especially the hard cases. They spent their own resources to bring God’s Word to other nations such as the Czech Republic and Uganda through biblical counseling training. They held nothing back (Matt. 16:24).\\nGeorge was humble. He never sought attention or accolades for himself as one of the fathers of the biblical counseling movement. He gladly received correction and quickly sought forgiveness when he was wrong (Prov. 9:8). He was glad to see the accomplishments of those whom he trained. His only desire was to see God’s kingdom advance.\\nGeorge was irenic. As a committed Presbyterian he worked well with committed believers from a wide variety of other denominations (even a Baptist like me) in a spirit of love and acceptance (Rom. 15:7).\\nGeorge was a man of prayer. I can’t remember a conversation in person or over the phone in which George didn’t ask, “How can I pray for you?” And then he prayed with passion and love (1 Thess. 5:17).\\nGeorge and Eileen together were a couple who reflected God’s grace and love in marriage. It is obvious that they deeply cared for one another and delighted in serving Christ and His church together (Eccl. 9:9).\\nIt is hard to imagine ACBC and IBCD meetings without George there to stand for the truth – and to add his unique sense of humor to our gatherings. It is harder to imagine that I will not be able to call him for counsel and prayer when I have a need or a question.

Jesus is my life\\nNow, Lord, I would be Yours alone\\nAnd live so all might see\\nThe strength to follow Your commands\\nCould never come from me\\nO Father, use my ransomed life\\nIn any way You choose\\nAnd let my song forever be\\nMy only boast is You\\nThis song expresses how I remember my friend and co-laborer for Christ George (Skip) Scipione. I first met Skip in the mid 70s as he was my instructor in the CCEF Introduction to Biblical Counseling Course. He immediately encouraged my heart and won my respect as a thorough exegete and practical teacher of God’s word. He immediately became a trusted confidant always pointing me to an answer from God’s Word and encouraging me to trust in Christ alone. It was my privilege to become a co-laborer for the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ with Skip for almost 30 years on the NANC/ACBC Board.\\nI remember Skip as the ‘Gatekeeper’ of ACBC, always pointing us to the Scriptures in every decision. I remember how forcefully and persuasively he would uphold the truth of the Scriptures. I remember how humbly he would ask forgiveness if he believed he had offended in any way. I remember his understanding that “a merry heart does good like a medicine” as he would bring in a pun to lighten the mood when we needed it. I remember how completely he would serve us on the Board even when you could see he was suffering physically. I remember how sacrificially he would give of himself to serve the cause of biblical counseling overseas in difficult places even when he was dealing with physical limitations. I remember his prayers for me personally and how tenderly he would lift me up before Jesus. I remember, and this is one of my sweetest memories from our ACBC Board meetings, his prayers for us as leaders to be compassionate counselors and to be faithful to the word. I remember his desire to see Jesus glorified in his life and to just be faithful to Him.\\nThese are some of my remembrances of Skip! I know that Skip’s prayer was this “Oh father, use my ransomed life in any way you choose and let my song forever be my only boast is you.” And now he stands before the throne of God the Father, boasting in the Lamb who was slain and is Risen. “Abba, Father, enable each of us to follow your faithful servant Skip’s example as he followed you. In the precious and powerful name of Jesus, we pray, Amen!”\\nRemembering Skip, Bob Somerville\\n\\n“In a sermon preached on Psalm 88, Charles Spurgeon once remarked, “I’ve learned to kiss the wave that throws me against the Rock of Ages!” My wonderful friend George Scipione was well acquainted with powerful waves and currents of opposition during his life of ministry for Christ. As an avid student of His Word, “Skip,” a fond nickname his friends so affectionately called him, fervently studied theology with a keen focus riveted on its practical application to life. In God’s perfect sovereignty, while at Westminster Theological Seminary, he became a student of pastoral counseling under the wise tutelage of Dr. Jay E. Adams. There was strong life-long friendship formed between these two men that would end up impacting churches all around the world.\\nIn the 1970s Jay E. Adams became the father of the church’s resurgent commitment to the sufficiency of Scripture in pastoral counseling and in biblical counseling in general. George Scipione was an eyewitness and critical early soldier of this ecclesiastical phenomena. At best, the idea of using the Bible alone for counseling was received with skepticism and open hostility from many Christians because of their loyalty to “Christian psychology.” As the battlefront formed Skip became a part of the first wave of attack on the unbiblical assumptions of psychology among Christians. He became a seasoned soldier defending biblical counseling and a crack troop in attacking the opposition with a carefully reasoned biblical apologetic. God used him to win many into the biblical counseling camp.\\nI was one of those he helped to win! Skip became a dear friend and life-long colleague when he welcomed me to the Board of Trustees of the National Association of Nouthetic Counselors in 1990 (NANC), which later changed the name to the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors (ACBC). Everyone on our Board loved him, his wise insight and quick humor was legendary. In fact, his faithfulness from the beginning of the establishment of NANC can be seen in the fact that he was still serving on the Board when the Lord called him home. George was our first, active board member to pass away while still actively serving. He will be greatly missed as a beloved brother, friend and professor with the pastoral heart of Christ. It is my hope that you will pray for his sweet wife, Eileen and their children, as they grieve his home-going. Until we meet again in Glory, dear beloved friend!”\\n— John Street, ACBC Board Member\\n\\nBelow is a sampling of resources from George over the years at our Annual Conferences.

      "{'title': 'Ernie Baker’s Biblical Counseling and the Psychologies', 'subtitle': 'Book review', 'author': 'Emily Stahly', 'question': 'This book teaches one how to discern through different counseling approaches and portrays how the Bible truly is sufficient in counseling.', 'body': 'As biblical counselors, we frequently encounter different counseling methods and systems—many making use of Scripture and biblical language—but how can we know if they are truly biblical? While some may think formal study of secular psychology and counseling theories is necessary, every biblical counselor regardless of education level or experience can learn to distinguish truth from error. In Biblical Counseling and the Psychologies, Ernie Baker offers a powerful crash course in discernment regarding different counseling approaches that would benefit counselors of any experience level.\\xa0\\nIn Biblical Counseling and the Psychologies, Baker sets out to show the need for discernment with “biblical eyeglasses” and to provide a paradigm that can be applied to any counseling system. He does this throughout three chapters: “A History of Biblical Eyeglasses,” “Understanding Two Secular Approaches,” and “A Biblical Approach.” Baker covers the historical need for discernment, evaluates cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and trauma-informed counseling with the “Seven S’s” framework, and uses the same framework to present a truly biblical approach to counseling. One of the key lessons of this book is that not every counseling system that uses scientific or biblical terminology can be trusted at face value as being sound or accurately representing God’s Word.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a pastor and biblical counselor with over four decades of experience, a professor of biblical counseling, and a student of David Powlison, Baker is uniquely well-positioned to speak to the issue of discernment within the biblical counseling movement. He corrects some misconceptions regarding Jay Adams and David Powlison’s stances and treatments of secular psychology, explaining that “Adams bluntly raised an alarm and Powlison cordially but clearly taught us to see discerningly” (29). Both Adams and Powlison opposed utilizing secular psychology for the care of souls because these systems have anti-biblical presuppositions (the foundational beliefs that shape how they see people and their problems).\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe core strength of Baker’s book is that he helps any counselor identify and evaluate those presuppositions by introducing Powlison’s “Six S’s paradigm”: source of authority, sin, salvation, sanctification, support systems, and sparring (apologetics). Baker also adds his own S: servants of the system. To help readers put this paradigm into practice, Baker examines CBT and trauma-informing counseling in chapter 2, warning of their unbiblical presuppositions regarding sources of authority, views of humans and their problems, and ways of helping people. He explains that the methodologies are not neutral: “Understand that the methodologies that are developed are the working out of a model of counseling, a view of people, and why they have problems. Using Powlison’s terminology—the methodologies have secular DNA. Scripture warns us repeatedly about mixing truth with error. (See Psalm 1)” (61).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBaker also addresses the issue of scientific and psychological research and the misconception that biblical counselors are anti-science. While there is value to proven and replicable scientific findings, he explains that much of what is promoted by approaches like trauma-informed counseling as “scientific fact” are overly simplified and often inaccurate according to quality scientific research and experts. Moreover, Baker emphasizes throughout the book that true scientific data is still filtered through secular eyeglasses by counseling systems. He writes, “A presuppositional biblical counselor will need to keep in mind that all research (especially in the ‘soft’ sciences) has biases, and that worldview impacts even the way studies are designed” (63). Secular psychologists may observe true facts, but how those facts are interpreted and pieced together will be very different than someone with biblical eyeglasses.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlong with these warnings against the undiscerning adoption of science, Baker argues that ultimately even accurate scientific knowledge is not necessary for biblical counselors. He asks, “Do we really need to know about the amygdala in order to help a counselee live a God-glorifying life as he processes horrific circumstances?” (59).\\xa0 Baker’s use of the case study of Larry helps readers see that the answer to the above question is no. Understanding how Larry’s brain works in light of past abuse and alcoholism may be interesting and helpful in a limited way—perhaps it will prompt the counselor to be more patient and compassionate towards him, for instance—but that knowledge will not help counselor guide Larry to live and respond in a God-honoring way. Not only is the Bible sufficient for counseling, it is the only thing that is necessary to understand people, their problems, and give them true and lasting hope found only in Christ. Baker puts it this way: “As you begin to see that we have all the ingredients that are considered part of a counseling system, you will see that we have a complete belief system. The end result will be that you will understand that there is no need to incorporate the beliefs of other systems” (36).\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is one section that I would ask counselors to pay close attention while reading. In discussing how Adams and Powlison helped him develop biblical eyeglasses, Baker states, “Just to be clear, I have personally benefited from the study of psychology. I am intrigued by the research on humans and have even benefited from reading about various counseling approaches” (29). The examples he gives are asking better questions after studying CBT and becoming more compassionate after studying trauma-informed counseling. He continues, “This does not mean that I am going to incorporate their theory-laden methodologies into my counseling. I am much more interested in exploring the depths of Scripture and mining its riches for helping people” (30).\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is true that we as biblical counselors can benefit from the study of the psychologies. Studying other systems can help raise questions we hadn’t considered before or perhaps expose some of our personal deficiency. But there is a world of difference between “I benefit from learning about opposing views and relying on Scripture to refine my counseling” and “I benefit from integrating secular psychological theories and methods into my counseling.” Unfortunately, there are those who claim to be biblical counselors who have adopted the second posture towards secular psychology. This makes Baker’s book so timely. \\xa0\\nMany of today’s conversations within the biblical counseling movement deal with this question of our relationship with secular psychologies and counseling approaches. Having a framework for evaluating counseling approaches, like the one presented in this book, is a prerequisite to answering that question. Counselors must seek to understand counseling systems with biblical eyeglasses before seeking to adopt any ideas or practices. I commend Baker for continuing the work of Powlison by his commitment to teach the next generation of biblical counselors how to be discerning and remain faithful to God’s Word.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nKey quotes:\\xa0\\n\\n“It is pragmatism and a highly questionable compromise to use these methodologies if you accept that the psychologies that developed these methodologies are philosophical belief systems that have a different view of humans than the Bible.” – 60\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“Adams showed me the consistency between what I was learning in theology class about the inerrancy of Scripture, and biblical counseling taking that doctrine seriously. Powlison taught me to think deeply about what sin has done to humans and, in particular, the biblical “heart.” He also taught me to think biblically about counseling systems using biblical presuppositions.” – Page 32.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“As stated before, every counseling system has goals it is endeavoring to attain with counselees. CBT has helped drug addicts. CBT has taught the Larrys of the world how to think differently about life. But CBT will not teach Larry a proper perspective of self. In fact, a core problem with humans is self because of the fall. CBT will only reinforce the core problem as he is taught not to think of himself as the problem but as the solution. He will become his own savior.” – Page 52.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“Because there is enough in the Bible to develop a complete counseling system, we should ask, how would the Bible want us to respond when we are about to have a panic attack or we are struggling with flashbacks of a horrible memory? And do we need to use secular therapies to provide real help or to work out the details of biblical principles? I believe the answer to this last question is no.” Page 59.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n“You now have a paradigm to discern what is being taught in both secular theories and even evangelical biblical counseling. I also hope that you are more confident that Scripture provides a complete counseling system to help the Larrys of the world, and that there is no need to syncretize with other systems.” – Page 87.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBook Reviews\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmily Stahly is the Publications Coordinator at the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'Heath Lambert’s Biblical Counseling and Common Grace', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Francine Tan', 'question': 'God’s ministry done in God’s way will never lack the resources needed to help people with their problems on this side of heaven.', 'body': 'What is common grace and its role in biblical counseling? How are biblical counselors able to value common grace without using its discoveries in counseling? In Biblical Counseling and Common Grace, Heath Lambert provides an accessible, theologically-faithful defense of the sufficiency of Scripture as it pertains to the doctrine of common grace. \\xa0\\nFrom trauma-informed counseling to evidence-based practices, the doctrine of common grace is now at the center of a shift from Scripture to psychology in the care of souls (p. 47). The argument is that since counselors have an ethical obligation to offer the best care possible, then it makes sense that believers would use helpful counseling interventions given to us by God’s common grace (p. 48). In Chapter 3, “Common Grace and Integration,” Lambert poignantly points out that this line of argument is not new. While the troubling developments regarding the doctrine of common grace are new in the history of pastoral care, the method of the evil one to turn the believer away from the riches of Scripture is always the same. Just as the apostle Paul warns the Colossian believers against the threat of Gnosticism that have an appearance of wisdom, but it is of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh and conforming the believer into the image of Christ (Colossians 2:23). Hence, Lambert warns the believer against a fascination that focuses on new secular interventions with faithful-sounding arguments—such as honoring general revelation or embracing common grace—as justifications to integrate psychology with Scripture. Although it has been relabeled, it is simply old-school integration (p. 71).\\xa0\\xa0\\nUsing a case study, Lambert addresses the doctrine of common grace with both theological clarity and pastoral warmth as it pertains to truth, sin, integration, and biblical counseling. Biblical counselors ought to recognize how common grace has substituted general revelation as a way to incorporate secular methodologies into soul care ministry which belongs. There is always a tradeoff. Just as Freud wanted pastoral workers to be secular (p. 49), the integration of Scripture and secular methodologies will only make counselors more secular, not more biblical. This is because as believers move away from God’s interpretation and intervention in counseling, they attempt to heal the wounds of people by saying, ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace (Jeremiah 6:14). Here, Lambert says, “I am ready to promise that eternity will reveal countless counselees who would gladly trade their time engaging such therapies, regardless of any common grace value they may hold, for time spent lingering over the Word of God” (p. 74). The wisdom of this age is doomed to pass away, which is why believers must be resolved to trust the wisdom and power of God in His revealed Word (1 Corinthians 2:5-7). God’s ministry done in God’s way will never lack the resources needed to help people with their problems on this side of heaven.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLambert also provides the believer with three lenses to evaluate the role of common grace in counseling methodology: the lens of assumption, the lens of analysis, and the lens of authority. With this tri-fold lens, believers will be equipped to theologically evaluate the observations, discoveries, and methodologies that are purportedly effective in helping people with their problems. Now, this does not mean that biblical counselors are dismissing or devaluing God’s goodness and kindness in His gift of common grace, but the role of common grace must be subservient to the role of special grace. This is because “common grace does not and cannot supply the strategy or content of counseling conversations. That role is reserved for special grace, and the Holy Scriptures are alone sufficient for that” (p. 81, emphasis mine). Reversing and subjugating the role of special grace under common grace will be detrimental for the counseling needs of man, which are ultimately spiritual in nature. Second Timothy 3:16-17 tells us, “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.” Nonetheless, one’s familiarity with these verses must not result in any functional disbelief in the veracity of these verses—God’s Word is sufficient for every good work. \\xa0\\nPersonally, I am deeply encouraged and challenged by Heath Lambert’s theological and pastoral concern for biblical counselors and believers alike on this topic, as he wrote this book after six significant brain operations. What is at stake, you may ask? Or if you think that the doctrine of common grace may be an obscure, secondary doctrine at the periphery of your counseling ministry, may Lambert’s words instruct and exhort you in this way:\\xa0\\nWhen we get frustrated with a perceived lack of resources in Scripture and become enamored with the latest secular therapy, we will do something very damaging to Scripture, to our souls, and to the people God gives us to help… When we step away from Scripture’s resources for counseling and utilize the world’s resources, we also hurt people by exchanging the Bible’s lasting, powerful, and Spirit-empowered principles with more or less harmful replacements. (p. 73)\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhether you are a seasoned counselor discerning the latest trend of trauma-informed counseling or a believer who has been struggling with the effects of trauma, this new book by Lambert is both clarifying and convicting on the issue of common grace. Christian, common grace costs God nothing; it flows out of the infinite repository of His perfections to all His creation. But the special grace of God costs Him everything—Jesus Christ died to save and sanctify the elect until glorification. God’s special grace alone is efficacious to finish the salvific and sanctifying work in every believer (Philippians 1:6).\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay you stand firm in the sufficient Word of God, trust in the superior power of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit for all that you need for life and godliness (2 Peter 1:3).\\xa0\\xa0\\nKey Quotes:\\xa0\\n\\nAn uncritical race to embrace secular theories based on a simplistic acceptance of common grace is the exact kind of intellectual laziness we would expect as a result of the noetic effects of sin (p. 33).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe clarity of biblical teaching on [the existence of an immaterial soul in every human being] demands that Christians use the lens of authority, declare that the Bible has the final say on the existence of the soul, and reject any self-styled expert with a divergent view (p. 44).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nNothing about the existence of approaches outside of Scripture does anything to erode the sufficient resources of Scripture (p. 66).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nWhen Scripture has powerfully impacted us, we will counsel Scripture. When the resources of the world have impacted us, that is what will come out of our mouths… When counselors get excited about the resources of the world, they reveal a gap in their own hearts that Scripture has not yet filled (p. 71-2).\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n[A] desire to offer real and lasting care demands the admission that it is secular resources, not scriptural resources, that are deficient to offer true help. Common grace requires the addition of special grace to offer real care, not the other way around (p. 78).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCommon grace never stops being a servant. Common grace does not and cannot supply the strategy or content of counseling conversations. That role is reserved for special grace, and the Holy Scriptures are alone sufficient for that (p. 81).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nEvery faithful Christian must lament the poverty of resources secular persons have in their attempt at solving the serious problems that plague broken people (p. 82).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBook Reviews\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrancine Tan is an ACBC-certified counselor from Malaysia and is currently pursuing her PhD in Biblical Counseling at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Hearts and Habits', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Julie DeVore', 'question': 'Everything we do is shaped by habits. But how do we form habits that aim at biblical change and the glory of God?', 'body': 'What if I told you that your habits and New Year’s resolutions are not about you? You read that correctly, your habits are not about you. Instead, they’re about glorifying God and honoring the people in your life. That is what Dr. Greg Gifford’s book, Heart and Habits is all about. There are no other Christian books on the market today that address how one’s heart and habits interact so that we avoid falling to one extreme of sentimentalism (emotions) or pragmatism (all actions).\\xa0\\nEverything we do is shaped by habits. In today’s society, habits are championed with self-seeking goals and behavior modification. People form legalistic and capricious habits that they hope to attain through sheer willpower, praise and bribery, so that they can be seen as healthy, productive members of society. However, these ambitions are self-centered and usually never fueled by the perspective of the Gospel (Philippians 2:3). Gifford explains that we should, “reject behavior modification that is void of any discussion of the need for a transformed heart” (page 17). In contrast, we should pursue heart transformation that affects one’s behaviors and habits.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt the core of everything we do is the heart, the seat of intentions and desires. These desires fuel our habits and actions (Luke 6:45). Having the ability to recognize how the heart affects habits enables habit formation to be aimed at the glory of God and not the glory of the individual (Colossians 3:23). This change in perspective gives power to habit development. When heart change motivates behavior change, then you no longer have to will yourself to wake up early. Instead, you desire to wake up early to be in the Word, exercise, and make breakfast for your family because you desire to live a godly life and you recognize how those habits enable you to do so. Gifford’s goal is “To help you understand the heart as it informs your habits, so you can develop habits for the glory of God and the good of people” (page 18). That is why habit formation is not really about you.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce we understand the role of the heart in habit formation, we can pursue habits with new vigor, as the Puritans would call it “vivification of our faith.” Gifford gives the example of a car accident. If a believer has practiced thinking about and approaching situations in light of God’s sovereign and loving purposes in everyday life, it’s more likely that their knee-jerk reaction to an accident will be trust, not panic. This is why a person needs to begin with the heart, and this change of desire changes habits that manifest outwardly. Heart change is the ultimate aim that “must drive habit development” (page 33). Not only is this a biblical perspective (as seen in Colossians 3), but it is also the most effective perspective because when desires change habits change.\\xa0\\xa0\\nChange at the heart level motivates actual habit change that is permanent and not temporary or self-willed. In Gifford’s own life, church attendance was something that began as a habit and moved to the heart. Gifford explains that, “When we understand the relationship of the heart and habits, we are free to be the most productive, physically healthy, relationally-connected, and vocationally-successful people we can be!” (Page 37). Believers who pursue heart change through the Holy Spirit will be refreshed seeing how the Holy Spirit brings conviction, desire, inducement and power to fuel obedience and godly habits (page 41). Godly habits will begin to form naturally and joyfully as believers pursue a Christ-like heart. Seeing how God has saved us and changed our hearts allows us to put off our old habits or self, and instead “put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator” (Colossians 3:10).\\xa0\\nHeart and Habits is an inspiring and practical book. Dr. Gifford not only explains the heart behind habit formation, but also provides helpful definitions, clear history, and practical examples. This book is full of worksheets and diagrams to aid each reader in applying what they are learning. Gifford outlines five spheres that are present in most individual lives as categories for readers to think through in habit formation. These habits should aim to glorify God at every level, no matter whether they are in the spiritual, personal, familial, vocational or social spheres. Using these spheres to categorize habit formation to the glory of God can help an individual break down their goals and heart motives into manageable parts. \\xa0\\nThis book is full of hope because it recognizes that successful habit formation is not dependent upon our own strength or will power. Instead, successful habits are a result of the life changing work of Jesus Christ in one’s heart. Therefore, believers can approach goals and resolutions with confidence in the Lord because they know that their greatest strength comes from the work of the Holy Spirit.

      "{'title': 'Competent to Counsel', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Omri Miles', 'question': 'This book provides insight into the birth of the biblical counseling movement. It bolsters confidence in God and His Scriptures.', 'body': '“The thesis of this book is that qualified Christian counselors properly trained in the Scriptures are competent to counsel—more competent than psychiatrists or anyone else” (page 18). This conviction, articulated by Jay Adams in 1970, was the spark that ignited the biblical counseling movement. As Adams chronicles his own unfortunate ignorance and ineptitude in counseling during his first pastorate, he describes what so many Christians know by experience—they are incompetent to counsel others. In this volume, Adams argues convincingly that Christians with knowledge, goodness, and wisdom are not only\\xa0able\\xa0to counsel others, but they\\xa0alone\\xa0are capable of counseling in a way that gives honor to God and offers true hope to men.\\xa0Competent to Counsel\\xa0is a timeless work from a faithful churchman that sketches the preliminaries of true biblical counseling according to the Scriptures. Adams readily admitted that “Much work yet remains to be done to construct a full and organized system of biblical counseling,”\\xa0but\\xa0Competent to Counsel\\xa0was an effective attempt nonetheless\\xa0(page 22). Jay Adams’\\xa0emphasis on the sufficiency and superiority of God’s Word, as well as his summary of nouthetic counseling, make this book a foundational must-read for anyone pursuing formal counseling ministry.\\xa0\\nThe Sufficiency of God’s Word\\xa0\\nAdams’ own discovery of the sufficiency of God’s\\xa0Word for counseling began when he “could not help but notice that the more directive [Adams] became (simply telling counselees what God required of them), the more people were helped” (page\\xa013).\\xa0In\\xa0Competent to Counsel,\\xa0Adams\\xa0provides basic answers to the rudimentary matters of counseling such as:\\xa0mental illness and bizarre behavior (chapter\\xa03), whose job it is to counsel (pages 41-43, 59-64, and chapter\\xa05), confession of sin (chapter\\xa06), solving man’s problems (chapter\\xa08), counseling techniques (chapter\\xa09), and communication issues (chapter\\xa010). Despite much progress\\xa0in the fifty years\\xa0since\\xa0its\\xa0release, biblical counselors will benefit from hearing Adams’ formative articulation of Scripture’s sufficiency regarding these foundational matters in counseling.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Superiority of God’s Word\\xa0\\nThe exaltation of God’s voice above all other counseling systems is also a highlight of this work. Adams demonstrates expert-level understanding of Sigmund Freud and Carl Rogers, yet eagerly exalts God’s superior wisdom in the Scriptures for counseling.\\xa0Adams confirms that,\\xa0“All that can be said of Freud is that his views have encouraged irresponsible people to persist in and expand their irresponsibility. He has sanctioned irresponsible behavior and made it respectable” (page\\xa017).\\xa0Similarly,\\xa0regarding person-centered therapy, Adams states,\\xa0“The Rogerian system confirms sinful man’s belief that he is autonomous and has no need of God.… It begins with\\xa0man\\xa0and it ends with man. Man is his own solution to his problems” (page\\xa082).\\xa0However, regarding the Bible, Adams insists, “Since the Holy Spirit employs his Word as the principal means by which Christians may grow in sanctification, counseling cannot be effective\\xa0…\\xa0apart from the use of the Scriptures” (pages\\xa023-24). “Counselors present biblical answers to man’s physical, social, intellectual and psychological needs” (page\\xa071). Adams’ conviction regarding the sufficiency and superiority of God’s Word led him to the conclusion that nouthetic counseling was the only way to counsel biblically.\\xa0\\nThe Summary of Nouthetic Counseling\\xa0\\nThe current understanding of biblical counseling finds its origin in the three elements of nouthetic confrontation\\xa0that\\xa0Adams\\xa0articulated\\xa0in\\xa0Competent to Counsel\\xa0more than half a century ago. These three components of biblical counseling include (1) a problem to be overcome, (2) verbal instruction, and (3) the good of the counselee. These preliminary observations from Jay Adams bear striking resemblance to\\xa0ACBC’s current mission\\xa0statement\\xa0and definition of biblical counseling,\\xa0provide further proof\\xa0that the biblical counseling movement has not outgrown Jay Adams in the slightest,\\xa0and Lord willing, it never will.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor those currently pursuing training in biblical counseling,\\xa0Competent to Counsel\\xa0provides insight into\\xa0the birth of the biblical counseling movement.

      "{'title': 'The Heart of Addiction', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Stephen Feinstein', 'question': 'Mark Shaw’s book is an excellent resource for biblical counselors helping those enslaved and burdened by addiction.', 'body': 'If you have ever counseled a person addicted to drugs or alcohol, you may have felt out of your depth. The world labels addiction as a disease, which implies counseling will not solve the problem. Also, the manic nature of some who are given over to substance abuse may often confuse the counselor as to the seriousness of the counselee’s request for help. Well, if these observations trouble you, or if you are troubled by addiction, fear not. Mark Shaw’s\\xa0The Heart of Addiction: A Biblical Perspective\\xa0both helps the addict and equips the counselor to biblically address and resolve this problem. \\xa0\\nTrue to biblical counseling, the book first sets out to identify the right vocabulary. What the world calls addiction, the Bible calls idolatry\\xa0(pages 7-8). This is the general term provided\\xa0by the Bible, and the more specific term is drunkenness. This latter word applies not only to alcohol, but any addictive substance. The varying degrees of severity of either addiction or abuse always result from the same inward problem of idolatry.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne helpful thing Shaw sets out early on is the incompatibility between the world’s disease concept and the Bible’s sin-nature concept as it relates to addiction\\xa0(pages 14-15). Though substance addiction or abuse manifest as physical problems, the root is always spiritual.\\xa0The fundamental problem for the addict is a worship disorder.\\xa0However, since humans\\xa0are\\xa0a psychosomatic union of body and soul, substances affect the body in natural/physical ways, leading to physical symptoms\\xa0(e.g., Proverbs 23:29-35), and often progress to emotional despair due to the struggle. However, these must be countered with objective truth, not emotional or subjective feelings. Furthermore, secular models seek to get the addict back to normal, but a biblical approach understands\\xa0that\\xa0normal is slavery to the sin nature, and therefore the biblical counselor aims to get the counselee to embrace and conform to the new creation in Jesus Christ. The heart must change. For the believer, God has already made the person into a new creation with a new heart, possessing the ability to break the idolatrous addiction. The unbeliever needs to repent and believe so they too may be granted divine enablement to overcome this sin. Shaw offers many helpful appendices, and the unbeliever is encouraged to read Appendix B\\xa0(pages 217-218).\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne problem with worldly models is they seek to simply break the habit, but this never achieves a permanent result. The Bible demonstrates the need to replace the bad habit with a new godly habit (Ephesians 4:22-24).\\xa0The human problem is we have an inclination toward sin, and each person differs in the\\xa0particular sins\\xa0in which\\xa0they\\xa0wish\\xa0to indulge. No one can blame God, however, for their addiction. Each addict is making an active choice to worship the substance over God. Therefore,\\xa0God requires\\xa0the putting\\xa0off of\\xa0the idolatrous addiction and the putting on\\xa0of the\\xa0worship\\xa0of God. He is supposed to be our greatest satisfaction, and when He\\xa0truly\\xa0replaces the false satisfactions of addiction\\xa0in both the heart and actions, the\\xa0addictive\\xa0cycle\\xa0will be\\xa0broken.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSadly, addiction often causes people to be feelings-oriented rather than principle-oriented. This explains their extreme behavior in being “on fire” when they are trying to get off the drug, but also the hard fall that quickly follows. They often are looking for the quick fix rather than the disciplined approach required by the Bible. Therefore, the way forward is active rather than passive. Shaw demonstrates a number of biblical examples where the believer wins the battle against sin by actively resisting the devil and persistently disciplining the flesh to get it into submission\\xa0(pages 132-134). This is even more important for the sin of idolatry and drunkenness since this slavery tends to affect and overwhelm every area of a person’s life. Shaw offers Appendix D (page 295) to help the addict understand this. The path to victory necessitates the putting off of the sin, which means removing certain people and situations from one’s life (Appendix C,\\xa0pages 219-223,\\xa0helps with this). It requires, as Proverbs 28:13 says, both confessing the sin and forsaking it. If one repeatedly confesses the slavery to a substance, but does not actively forsake it, then the confession is empty. Furthermore, if the desire to put off is genuine, then it must be supplemented with the renewing of the mind. We absorb so much of the world’s faulty thinking that we need to renew our thoughts on this subject with God’s own words. When one seeks to worship God first and forsakes sin while being immersed in Scripture (i.e., reading, memorizing, and meditating), then motives, thoughts, and desires change (Appendix G,\\xa0pages 235-238,\\xa0helps with renewing the mind).\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn conjunction with the putting off of the substance and the renewing of the mind, Shaw highlights the need to put on the right things. Serving the church with one’s spiritual gifts is a huge component of this\\xa0(pages 176-177), since the opposite of drunkenness is being filled with the Holy Spirit. Also necessary are the attitudes of responsibility, gratitude, and a submissive spirit. The counselee needs to submissively follow through on the restructuring of his life (Appendix F,\\xa0pages 233-234,\\xa0offers much practical help). The replacement of the wicked with the righteous behaviors requires the mentality of a Nazarite (page 195). Finally, legitimate rehabituation (i.e., replacing the sinful habit with a biblical habit) requires one to shift from being self-focused to being other-focused. When a person stays away from the substance, is immersed in Scripture, and is actively loving God and others and putting them first, indeed the person will be free from the idolatry. The person instead has put on the new man which is being conformed to Christ’s image. And of course, none of this is possible without the indwelling of the Holy Spirit who will make all this operative in transforming the individual.\\nShaw has provided biblical counselors an excellent resource to help those enslaved and burdened by addiction.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHelpful Quotes:\\xa0\\n“Both the love of pleasure and the avoidance of pain (or escape) fuel any addiction” (page 7).\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Know this: if you are a Christian struggling with an addiction, occasional substance abuse, or drunkenness, you will always be God’s son or daughter; however, your relationship with God is hindered by your chemical use” (page 63).\\xa0\\n“The truth is that every human being on planet Earth is capable of becoming ‘addicted’ to any pleasurable activity because of the capacity for idolatry in the human heart” (page 79).\\xa0\\n“When churches promote the unbiblical idea of reaching a point in life where a Christian can become perfect, or sinless, they are driving addicts—and all those that struggle with sin for that matter—away from the church and to secular modalities. Churches that promote ‘perfection’ in this life are not biblically grounded in this doctrine of sanctification” (page 169).\\xa0\\n“God creates in your heart a change from your desires to fulfill\\xa0self-centered and temporary\\xa0pleasures to a desire to fulfill\\xa0self-less and everlasting\\xa0pleasures that please God first and foremost. The primary goal of the biblical counselor is to challenge the Christian addict to desire nothing less than this type of genuine heart change” (page 185).\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBook Reviews\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStephen Feinstein is an ACBC certified counselor with an MDiv from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and he serves as a pastor at Sovereign Way Christian Church as well as a Chaplain (LTC) in the United States Army Reserves.', 'source': 'url'}\n",

This begs the question, “How do we do that?” Dr.\\xa0Jay Adams endeavors to answer that question in his book,\\xa0How to Help People Change: The Four-Step Biblical Process.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn Part I, Dr. Adams introduces the concept of biblical change.\\xa0The goal of biblical change\\xa0is\\xa0pleasing\\xa0God, and\\xa0this\\xa0is accomplished by the power of the Holy Spirit. The process of this change is laid out in 2 Timothy 3:16\\xa0and involves teaching, convicting, correcting, and training in righteousness. Dr. Adams spends the remainder of the book expanding on this process, step-by-step.\\nStep 1 in the process is\\xa0“teaching.”\\xa0Dr. Adams\\xa0explains that true biblical teaching\\xa0is teaching to habitually\\xa0observe Christ’s transcultural, unchanging, authoritative commands.\\xa0This happens through the process of not only formal weekly counseling, but\\xa0assigning\\xa0homework that enables counselees to put God’s\\xa0Word into practice in normal, day-to-day situations.\\xa0\\xa0\\nStep 2 is “convicting.” Conviction involves ministering the Word in the power of the Spirit in order that counselees\\xa0realize that they are\\xa0falling short of God’s standards. Counselors must gather data, interpret it according to biblical categories, and use it to help their counselees view their lives (i.e., actions, feelings, responses, words, thoughts) in light of Scripture. Dr. Adams also comments on the necessity to differentiate not only between needs and desires, but also between conviction and introspection. He also points out the insufficiency of a mere change in thinking, and the hope in confronting sin, and dullness of heart.\\nStep 3, “correcting,”\\xa0is\\xa0the natural progression from\\xa0convicting.\\xa0Since counselors cannot see a man’s heart,\\xa0they\\xa0must create observable opportunities for correction, which is why homework is necessary.\\xa0Correction does not come without repentance, which encompasses\\xa0confessing\\xa0sin to God and men, seeking forgiveness, abandoning sinful practices, and beginning new God-pleasing practices.\\xa0Dr. Adams provides an extensive explanation of the elements of true biblical repentance, such as confessing and forsaking sin, and restoration within the body of Christ.\\nIn Step 4,\\xa0“training\\xa0in righteousness,” Adams contends that biblical counselors often miss this important step\\xa0and\\xa0make their counseling\\xa0both\\xa0incomplete and\\xa0ineffective in\\xa0helping\\xa0counselees with continual discouraging failure.\\xa0The counselor’s goal is to help counselees, who are already righteous in Christ, flee self-righteousness and put on true Christlike righteousness. Many are tempted to think this is impossible due to their continual battles with sin along with their understanding of Romans 7:14-25. However, Adams reminds\\xa0his readers\\xa0that, according to\\xa0Romans 6, 1 Peter 4, and 1 John, righteous living is\\xa0not only\\xa0possible,\\xa0it is promised and therefore\\xa0expected.\\xa0One key to this training in righteousness is the concept of habit. Habits enable us to do our normal activities unconsciously. Sadly, we have twisted these blessings and developed sinful habits while living in the flesh. We need new habits by the power of the Word and Spirit.\\xa0Such patterns need to be established before counseling ceases.\\xa0\\nThere are several strengths to this book that make it a useful resource, particularly for younger biblical counselors. First, Dr. Adams possessed a wonderful and rare ability to provide biblical steps, processes and methods without delving into moralism and pragmatism. He always remains Gospel-centered, God-exalting, and emphasizes the Spirit’s power. Second, the case studies are wonderful illustrations that encourage counselors with the hope that they too can minister the Scriptures in such a way that encourages biblical change in people’s lives. Finally, Dr. Adams addresses the issue of integrating psychology into counseling and delivers a robust and concise defense of the sufficiency of Scripture. On a personal note, this writer has yet to come across a more helpful answer to that fiercely contested issue.

      "{'title': 'A Theology of Biblical Counseling', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Marla Stanley', 'question': 'Heath Lambert builds a theological framework for counseling, piece by piece, to show that the very foundation for counseling is indeed theological in nature.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert has written an invaluable resource with\\xa0A Theology of Biblical\\xa0Counseling: The Doctrinal Foundations of\\xa0Counseling\\xa0Ministry.\\xa0Lambert builds\\xa0a theological framework for counseling,\\xa0piece by piece,\\xa0to show that the very foundation for counseling is indeed theological in nature. He connects core doctrines to the work of counseling in an incredibly practical and understandable manner.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDr.\\xa0Lambert is a pastor, father, dedicated biblical counselor, and theologian whose engaging work has now built upon so many who came before him in this field.\\xa0One question frames Lambert’s work:\\xa0“What serves as the culmination of our theological knowledge?” (page\\xa0317) This inquiry\\xa0drives\\xa0each chapter to take richly theological content to an incredibly practical level. This writing is not merely for gaining knowledge but will assist you in knowing God via relationship with Christ. It will help you use every bit of theological prowess in an outpouring of worship to Father God. As you read and study, you will be captured by real-life stories,\\xa0thoughtful experiences,\\xa0and\\xa0well-placed Scripture to illuminate the ideas on the page.\\xa0\\nLambert articulates with striking clarity a thorough summary of key doctrines and their relevance to the ministry of biblical\\xa0counseling:\\xa0Scripture, Common Grace, God, Christ, Holy Spirit, Humanity, Sin, Suffering, Salvation, and the Church. The introduction alone sheds\\xa0light on the crossroads of Theology and Counseling and should be required reading for every believer. Lambert clearly builds the case for counseling as a “theological discipline” (page 11). When we acknowledge the reality that “Counseling is a conversation where one party with questions, problems, and trouble seeks assistance from someone they believe has answers, solutions, and help” (page\\xa013), we can embrace the role theology has in helping each individual with their counseling problems, and the role of the counselor as one who is\\xa0required to have an understanding of what God desires in order to be able to offer those answers, solutions, and help.\\xa0\\nWhen the counselor speaks, we desire those words, that advice, and that specific guidance to be rooted in the Scriptures as an anchor of truth.\\xa0To\\xa0do this, we\\xa0have to\\xa0not only know the Word of God, but also\\xa0understand aspects of the Theology of Scripture (Chapter\\xa02): inerrancy, sufficiency, the role of the Scriptures in church history, and further categories of sufficiency. Particularly when so much of our modern day counseling relies on external resources and is not centered on doctrine, Lambert cuts to the core of each angle necessary around this issue of the Scriptures as our source and solution.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLambert has written so well about the necessity of the Spirit’s work to convict, indwell, teach, empower, offer gifting, and glorify in the life of the individual receiving counsel. In Chapter 6, each of the Holy Spirit’s functions are explained along with five ways we as biblical counselors ought to respond to this doctrine of the Holy Spirit as it pertains to our work. Nestled within this chapter is the sharp reality that our\\xa0work is utterly dependent upon the Holy Spirit.\\xa0We submit to His Lordship as “He is the one who makes all real and lasting change possible” (page\\xa0179).\\xa0\\nContinuing in Chapter 9, “Because of Adam’s sin against God in the garden, all people now live in a world of profound pain” (page\\xa0248). Why is there suffering?\\xa0This is\\xa0a common question that arises in biblical counseling, and it must be addressed with care and empathy.\\xa0Lambert helps the reader\\xa0to rightly divide suffering’s various causes:\\xa0sin, the world, the\\xa0devil, confusion, and death. Lambert is honest when he acknowledges that often our answers from Scripture around suffering may not be the kind of answers our counselees desire, but nevertheless, “We point counselees to the strong and loving character of God and plead with them to trust him. We appeal to them to believe that when bad things happen, we can trust that he loves us in his care and is able to use his power in good ways that may not be understandable to us” (page\\xa0261).\\xa0\\nThis volume is an absolute necessity in the library of any dedicated biblical counselor, student of biblical counseling, or pastor seeking to offer the full counsel of the Word.\\xa0It provides\\xa0rich\\xa0concepts\\xa0and will aid a counselor\\xa0to truly lay a solid foundation for the work to which each of us is called. May we each be prepared to give answers and submit to the work of the Spirit in every counseling relationship.\\xa0\\nHelpful Quotes\\xa0\\n“In counseling, when people share their most serious and secret problems, counselors need to have something to say” (page\\xa037).\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The doctrine of the sufficiency of Scripture is a promise that God himself will give you something from him to say in those sacred moments” (page\\xa038).\\xa0\\n“The Holy Spirit is vital to a biblical approach to\\xa0counseling.\\xa0In fact, if biblical counselors were to offer any qualifications to their theology of the sufficiency of Scripture, it would have to do with the doctrine of the Spirit” (page\\xa0161).\\xa0\\n“My personal creed in counseling is: ‘When in doubt, check it out.’ When I am counseling someone who is experiencing a problem that is extreme, new, bizarre, or out of the ordinary in any way, I encourage that person to see a physician for a full medical exam….\\xa0It helps me to see all the potential problems in the counselee, both in body and soul” (page\\xa0202).\\xa0\\n“The goal of counseling those who have been sinned against is to have them extend forgiveness to those who have wronged\\xa0them, and\\xa0do it in such a way that they see the person and the sinful act as two separate realities.

      "{'title': 'The Faithful Parent: A Biblical Guide to Raising a Family', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Nathan Moore', 'question': 'Success is not measured by how our children turn out, but by how we honor the Lord in our parenting.', 'body': '“Parents and children need help, a lot of help” (page\\xa03). To this line on the book’s first page, all the parents, pastors, and counselors say “Amen.” Thankfully, Martha Peace and Stuart Scott have written\\xa0The Faithful Parent: A Biblical Guide to Raising a Family\\xa0to provide some of that much-needed help.\\xa0\\nThe main idea running throughout this book is that rather than striving to produce Christian children, parents should instead focus on their own parental faithfulness. Success is not measured by how our children turn out, but by how we honor the Lord in our parenting.\\xa0As frustrating as it may seem, we simply cannot control our children, and God doesn’t expect us to. Instead, God is calling us to trust and obey Him as we seek to raise our children in the fear of the Lord.\\xa0\\nThe contents of this book are organized into three sections. Part One clarifies the Bible’s expectations for parents and children through a pair of two-fold purpose statements. Faithfulness demands that parents both discipline and instruct their children. Children then must be careful to\\xa0obey\\xa0and\\xa0honor\\xa0their parents. These purpose statements are useful for bringing clarity to the counseling room. In Chapter Two, Peace and Scott admonish parents to be both evangelists and theologians who repeatedly bring the character of God, the reality of sin, and the need for grace to their children. The faithful parent will provide gospel-oriented evangelism and discipleship throughout childhood and well into the teenage years.\\xa0\\nPart Two addresses how faithful parents should interact with their children during the different stages of their lives, dedicating a chapter to each of the five developmental stages. The authors follow a familiar pattern in each chapter by reviewing major developmental milestones, how the Bible views this stage of childhood, and then offers considerations for how parents can provide age-appropriate discipline and instruction. Each chapter also includes some commonsense tips and discussion questions, which counselors may want to assign as a part of a counselee’s homework. These five chapters are full of practical counsel and give special attention to the most relevant biblical commands. Though the authors don’t include a detailed treatment of the heart, these chapters make it clear that parents should strive for lasting character formation, not merely behavioral manipulation. One of the book’s strengths is how the authors encourage parents to wed discipline, instruction, and discipleship together with the character and skills involved in being a life-long disciple of Christ. Parents should teach their children how to maintain friendships, resolve conflict, practice thanksgiving, interact with foolish people, and exercise self control.\\nChapter 8 is the standout chapter in the book addressing the often-overlooked problem of “Parents Who Provoke” their children (Colossians\\xa03:21). Here, the authors identify fifteen common attitudes that parents may sinfully adopt, provoking their children. These range from “The Proud Parent” to “The Why Can’t You be Like Your Brother? Parent.” By attaching these common struggles to the biblical language of “provoking,” this chapter will provide plenty of counseling fodder for those who seek to walk alongside struggling parents.\\xa0\\nPart Three addresses special parenting cases by identifying the most pertinent biblical principles which apply to issues like single\\xa0parenting, blended families, or parenting children with special needs. Though brief, these sections are a way for counselors to quickly orient themselves to how the Bible may speak to situations such as these.\\xa0\\nChapter 10 provides help for parents who are grieving rebellious children and organizes the material into a month’s worth of daily devotions. Counselors would be helped to familiarize themselves with the appendices and tables in this book, some of which may prove immediately applicable to ministry. The “Put Off” / “Put\\xa0On” chart in Appendix B (see also 189–191) and the “Taking Thoughts Captive” worksheet in Appendix D will certainly be sources of inspiration for counselors looking for helpful homework ideas.\\xa0\\nOverall, this book will be informative and encouraging to those who are seeking to honor God in their parenting. Biblical counselors will appreciate it for the same reasons and will likely find its appendices and charts reason enough to keep it on a shelf close to their counseling chair.\\xa0\\nHelpful\\xa0Quotes\\xa0\\n“In all of eternity, there has been only one perfectly faithful parent, and he had the only perfectly faithful son” (page\\xa03).\\xa0“Faithfulness, not perfection, is rewarded by the Lord. That’s because we can no more live a sinless life than we can make our children do the same thing. Only our Lord Jesus is he\\xa0‘who knew no sin’\\xa0(2 Cor. 5:21). He never sinned, but we do, and he knew we would need his help and encouragement to raise our children faithfully as he desires” (page\\xa05).\\xa0“A person who is striving to honor the Lord in parenting, repenting, and changing is a faithful parent” (page\\xa05).\\xa0“Take care that you do not seek to micromanage your children’s faith or expect total sanctification\\xa0today\\xa0in their lives. You can’t force them to grow, but you can lead them gently” (page\\xa032).\\xa0“Time out places a child who is raging in his heart into a seat. Then he plays over and over in his mind the circumstances that made him angry. Ultimately, the child will likely calm down, but it is not good for him to have all that time to brood in his heart” (page\\xa061).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBook Reviews\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNathan Moore is a pastor and ACBC certified counselor serving in the mountains of East Tennessee.

      "{'title': 'Biblical Crisis Counseling: Not If, But When', 'subtitle': 'Book Review', 'author': 'Steve Cranston', 'question': 'John Babler teaches how to walk a counselee through trials by trusting God’s hope and healing, while emphasizing the importance of glorifying God.', 'body': 'Early in\\xa0Biblical Crisis Counseling: Not If, But When,\\xa0Dr. John Babler makes a candid admission that lets the reader know he’s “real” and which endears him to each of us as “qualified” to be both a biblical counselor and seminary professor,\\xa0as well as an excellent husband and father. Here’s an exemplary excerpt, “Some of the biggest challenges for me have been when life and death crises have occurred and there was nothing I could do to protect my children or grandchildren”\\xa0(page 3).\\xa0\\nWhile the book isn’t either lengthy or difficult to read, it is filled with practical, useful information and personal illustrations from the author’s life experiences in many roles. He talks about childhood family crises, those as a parent, grandparent, firefighter and, of course his vast experiences as a “crisis” biblical counselor.\\xa0\\nThe author provides a great service in distinguishing the difference(s) between “biblical” counseling and all other types, including Christian, and even those claiming to be biblical.\\xa0He writes, “I have had the opportunity to read and reflect on many recent attempts to define biblical counseling by those who consider themselves to be biblical counselors. To my surprise, many of these definitions missed key foundational elements. None of them mention sin or repentance, only one refers to a conviction regarding the sufficiency of Scripture, and they are all broad enough to allow many who hold contradicting philosophies to adopt the title of biblical counselor”\\xa0(page 11).\\xa0\\nOne of many things the reader should appreciate about this book is that it isn’t another self-help dissertation. For anyone who desires to give biblical counsel (which should include each Christian), the author addresses root causes for the “issues” everyone experiences at times, therefore helping us understand why people conduct themselves as they do.\\xa0Chapter 5, Job, Joseph and Jonah: Three Men in Crisis, illustrates significant heart-level truths revealed in the experiences of each of these men. While not giving details here, the summary to this chapter is a very good one:\\xa0“In each of these situations, God used crisis to reveal the hearts of men. One repented, one consistently obeyed, and one, though used by God, showed no evidence of repentance despite outward compliance. Using these truths from Scripture will help us as biblical counselors to understand people in crisis. While the outward circumstances will differ, the human heart is unchanging, and men today will respond even as these men did. Our job as biblical counselors\\xa0is to\\xa0reflect these truths, for we are compelled to speak God’s Word and call upon Him to use His truth to transform lives”\\xa0(pages 43-44).\\xa0\\nChapter 6 is especially\\xa0helpful,\\xa0beginning\\xa0with Dr. Babler sharing how he and several others, “out of the tragedy at the Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting…worked together to develop the Biblical Crisis Intervention (BCI) model” (page 45).\\xa0In a creative and practical way, this chapter starts with a visual illustration of an umbrella which contains (around the handle) the four foundations of the BCI model: Biblical, Relational, Wholistic, and Practical. It then shows (in the four sections of the canopy) the elements the biblical crisis counselor uses to minister: compassion, listening, serving and ministering Scripture. Especially convincing to the reader is the fact that this chapter is filled with Scripture (texts and references) which illustrate both the “foundations” and the “elements” of the Biblical Crisis Intervention model.\\xa0This chapter both establishes and illustrates the practicality of “biblical crisis counseling.”\\xa0\\nAppropriately, the book concludes with chapter 8,\\xa0titled Disaster Relief and the Church. It begins (page 78) by reminding us that,\\xa0“Crises and disasters have many faces. Hurricanes, floods, fires, earthquakes and tornadoes all may have disastrous effects on communities, cities and entire nations.” It then continues by stating that the Biblical Crisis Intervention model is one that can be practically applied in any and every\\xa0disaster situation. The author details “Practical Warnings,” instructions regarding “Operating an Emergency Shelter at Your Church” and then “Suggestions for Specific Disasters.”\\xa0He goes into great detail to give an immense amount of practical information about almost every conceivable aspect of ministering to those overtaken by the previously illustrated crises and yet does so in a concise, practical, and interesting way.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI\\xa0highly recommend\\xa0Biblical Crisis Counseling:\\xa0Not If,\\xa0But When\\xa0as potentially the best manual one could obtain to be thoroughly educated and (hopefully) biblically and spiritually motivated to minister God’s Word to those in need, whether in an extreme crisis or a more moderate “normal life” circumstance.\\xa0\\nHelpful Quotes\\xa0\\n“Most people have experienced some type of personal crisis and certainly are at least aware through the media of the devastation of large-scale disaster….\\xa0It is the focus of this book to challenge Christians to consider that crises provide opportunities. The first and most obvious of which is to glorify and honor God”\\xa0(page 13).\\xa0“Crisis ministry requires an investment into the lives of others. We must be willing to sacrifice time,\\xa0 money, energy, comfort, and belongings. When people around us panic, we must remain calm and trust the\\xa0sovereignty of God. We must gently lead those in crisis toward Christ and help them to see God’s hand at\\xa0work in their circumstances.

      "{'title': 'Reasons Why I Love Being an ACBC Fellow', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Paul Tautges', 'question': 'Counseling certification is not about obtaining a certificate to hang on your wall, but growing toward spiritual maturity and love so as to be more useful to our Lord and His church.', 'body': 'ACBC is an organization that I’ve been pleased to be part of for many years; first, as a conference attendee, then a certified counselor, and currently a teaching fellow. ACBC has a rich, 45-year history of involvement in the training and certification of men and women who love Jesus Christ, but also want to more effectively minister His grace and truth into the lives of others as biblical counselors. Below are five reasons I love being part of this organization.\\nACBC is committed to the ongoing pursuit of excellence in biblical counselor training and certification.\\xa0Excellence, not mediocrity, is the pursuit of the leaders and members of ACBC. Yes, the training is rigorous at every level, but it is well worth it and will lead to significant personal growth in your own walk with the Lord. Counseling certification is not about obtaining a certificate to hang on your wall, so that you can then hang out a shingle (although some may), but it’s about growing toward spiritual maturity and love so as to be more useful to our Lord and His church (Ephesians 4:12; Colossians 1:28-29).\\nACBC is committed to theological clarity and precision, which grows out of a commitment to the sufficiency of the Scriptures for life and godliness.\\xa0We stand without apology on the inerrancy, authority, and sufficiency of the Bible as God’s words to man. The Scriptures are sufficient for all that pertains to living a life that glorifies Christ our Lord and Redeemer (2 Peter 1:3; 2 Timothy 3:16-17). My fellow Fellows not only love theology, but they love the Lord of theology. For further study on the sufficiency of Scripture, see Steve Viars’ and my chapter in\\xa0Scripture and Counseling,\\xa0one of the volumes produced by the Biblical Counseling Coalition.\\nACBC does not believe it has arrived, but is committed to continued growth in our understanding of human behavior, the body/soul connection, and the heart issues that drive us.\\xa0Behavior modification is not our business. Our business is to plead with God for wisdom to discern how the Spirit is at work in fellow believers in order to come alongside one another to help in the ongoing process of applying theology to life (Ephesians 4-6). ACBC rightly views the Christian life as an ongoing journey of sanctification toward becoming like Christ. I am pleased to be part of a body of men and women who view themselves as lifelong students of the Lord.\\nACBC is committed to building up local churches through training all those who desire to become willing servants of God in the process of making disciples of Jesus Christ.\\xa0Rightly understood, biblical counseling is an intensive aspect of the Great Commission to multiply disciples of Christ (Matthew 28:18-20), which is a command given to all believers in the primary context of the local church. ACBC understands this and affirms it in practice. Sanctification is a community project. ACBC gets this!\\nACBC is committed to pursuing and multiplying a “pastoral heart” toward others.\\xa0Biblical counseling is a ministry of love for every believer, not simply pastors and church leaders; it’s a biblical responsibility to speak the truth in love to one another. This means that a pastoral heart is not only for pastors. A pastoral heart is one which longs for the spiritual good in others and, therefore, seeks to do all in its power to be part of the process of leading others closer to Jesus, the one and only Redeemer for desperate sinners like you and me (Romans 1:11; 15:14).\\nAs one who continues to be blessed by being involved in the ministry of ACBC, I encourage you to check them out. Involvement at any level will surely enrich your own walk with the Lord and expand your ministry of love toward other believers.\\n\\nThis blog was originally posted at Counseling One Another,\\xa0view the original post here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCertification\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaul Tautges is an ACBC certified counselor and the Senior Pastor at Cornerstone Community Church in Mayfield Heights, OH.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
      "{'title': 'The Value of Training in Biblical Counseling', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Brad Brandt', 'question': \"One pastor's testimony of how God used biblical counseling training to sustain his ministry—and himself.\", 'body': 'Thirty-three years ago, the Lord privileged me to become the pastor of Wheelersburg Baptist Church, in Appalachian southern Ohio, where I presently serve. At the time, the church was 109 years old. I was 26 and had just finished four years of Bible college and another four years of seminary. I believed the Bible was the inerrant, infallible, trustworthy Word of God. I was committed to preaching it, making disciples by it, and equipping this precious congregation to live by it.\\nThen it started. People began opening up to me, saying things like, “Pastor, we’re having marriage problems.” And “Pastor, I’ve been told I’m bipolar.” And “Pastor, they say our child has ADHD, and we’re overwhelmed.” Then came the question, “Pastor, can you help us?”\\nI responded by listening, praying with them, expressing my concern and support, reading a Scripture or two, but that was about it. I sensed they needed more, but I didn’t know how to provide it.\\nConsequently, I saw a couple of things happen. First, some of the strugglers went outside the church for help. Unfortunately, though well-meaning I’m sure, this “professional” help typically didn’t increase the hurting person’s confidence in Christ, His Word, and His church. In fact, at times it undermined this confidence. A second outcome I observed was that some hurting people continued to limp along in isolation, receiving little or no help, convinced that no help was available.\\nRecognizing the Need\\nAfter seven years of pastoring this way, I knew something needed to change. I needed to change. The Lord had called me to shepherd His flock, and I wasn’t doing it. Frankly, I didn’t know how to do it.\\nBut it was more personal than that. I didn’t know how to deal with problems in my own life. I would walk through the door into my home in the evening, and my wife would ask, “How was your day?” My standard answer was, “Fine, dear. It was fine.” It didn’t matter if I’d been putting out church fires all day. Everything was always fine. I thought that’s what the good Christian response was. Just be positive. Don’t get angry. Things will work out. But they didn’t.\\nPlease don’t misunderstand. New people were coming. The giving was good. The church was growing. We had programs and activities for all ages, with lots of people serving. But something seemed amiss. In reality, a storm was brewing.\\nTwelve Long, Valuable Mondays\\nAbout 26 years ago, in God’s incredible kindness, I heard about and signed up for a 12-week course in biblical counseling hosted by Clearcreek Chapel near Dayton, Ohio. It was there I learned from three pastors what the Bible says about the real problems my people were experiencing, that I was experiencing. That was a tough stretch, leaving the house at 6 a.m., listening to lectures in the morning, doing case studies in the afternoon, observing biblical counselors in action in the evening, and then driving home, pulling in the driveway somewhere between 9 and 11 p.m. It was tough . . . and life-changing.\\nI wouldn’t be in the ministry today if it hadn’t been for biblical counseling training. Click To Tweet\\nA pastor friend of mine recently said, “I wouldn’t be in the ministry today if it hadn’t been for biblical counseling training.” I agree. That practical course opened my eyes to the reality that God’s Word is not only inerrant and authoritative, it is sufficient to deal with the complex challenges hurting people are facing.\\nThe training produced a series of changes, starting with me and my family. I learned from God’s Word how I could, instead of clamming up, deal with problems God’s way. I learned there is no such thing as a problem-free life or family or church and that God’s kind of life, family, and church is one that deals with its problems His way. He shows us what His way is in the Book.\\nNext it began to change the church. I began a Sunday evening series, “Biblical Answers for the Problems of Life.” We learned together what the Bible says about marriage, parenting, fear, worry, depression, and much more. I also began to do biblical counseling with people in the church and community, and I went through the rigorous yet valuable process of becoming certified with what is now the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.\\nGood things were happening, but not everyone was pleased. In 1998 our church went through a firestorm; by the time the flames subsided, we had lost one-third of our members. There were many contributing factors (differences over doctrine, music, methodology, etc.), but at the root it had to do with a vital clarifying question.\\nThe Clarifying Question\\nWe had to ask ourselves, “Are we going to be a truly biblical church?” Specifically, “Do we believe that the Bible is sufficient? Will we deal with our problems by heeding this Book God has given us? When we have conflict, will we lay aside our Baptist-subculture expectations and affirm that this Book is the key to life and godliness?”\\nIt was so painful; and, frankly, in a very real sense it still is. We looked like a severely pruned tree after the departures finally stopped. But as is the case with a pruned tree, we were now ready for a remarkable season of fruit-bearing that not one of us could have anticipated.\\nTwenty years ago, as a church we realized that God had given us something we could not keep to ourselves. So we began our first year of training in biblical counseling. About 50 people from nine area churches were in that first class. The next year we offered a second track. The following year we began offering an advanced track, as well as continuing our fundamentals track. Eventually others in our church family began counseling and teaching. We started going on the road to do training in other places, even overseas.\\nI don’t even know the numbers for sure, for they don’t really matter—a lesson the Lord has been teaching me for three decades. Many hundreds of people from mostly small churches in the region of southern Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia have participated in our courses. Ministry is all about God’s glory, and His glory is manifest when He works through weak vessels like us to accomplish His eternally significant plan to transform hurting sinners into His Son’s likeness. Our counseling team has been offering free counseling to our Tri-State region for 20 years now. Dozens of people every year are finding hope from the Scriptures. Marriages are being restored. People struggling with depression, fears, and anxieties are learning to experience the joy of Christlikeness in their struggles. And for this we say, to God be the glory!\\nActs 20:20 Ministry\\nIn the twenty-first century, we need Acts 20:20 ministries. So, pastor friend, I commend to you the value of a 20:20 ministry, the kind of Word-centered ministry the apostle Paul described in Acts 20:20, “I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house” (NIV). There is a need, says Paul, for the ministry of the Word on two fronts. There’s the public ministry of the Word (preaching). But there’s also the private, house-to-house ministry of the Word, which is what biblical counseling is all about. When we preach, we take the Word to people. When we counsel, we take people to the Word.\\nTraining in biblical counseling is worth the effort. If you have never received such training, I urge you to consider it. Find the ACBC training center closest to you. Take a course and pursue certification. Encourage others in the congregation to do the same. You won’t regret it.\\n\\nThis article first appeared in the Baptist Bulletin (July/August 2020), copyright © Regular Baptist Press. Used by permission.

      "{'title': '4 Reasons to Pursue Certification this Year', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'David Champagne', 'question': 'You counsel every day. Do you do it well?', 'body': 'What are your goals as you think about this year? There are so many worthy endeavors, so many objectives to pursue, and so many very good ways to spend your time. As you pray and consider this year of ministry, I want to encourage you to take a serious look ACBC certification. You may be new to the concept of biblical counseling. You may be very involved in counseling, but have been putting off the certification process for one reason or another. Here are 4 reasons why you should consider starting your journey toward certification, or jumping back in where you left off.\\n1. We are surrounded by brokenness \\xa0\\nThe heart is truly an idol factory. As we seek to follow Jesus, our hearts are constantly leading us astray, trying to convince us that there is something out there; some success, some relationship, some new level of achievement that will satisfy us more than Christ. This constant loop always leads to brokenness, and nothing in this world can heal brokenness like the Gospel. The intensive discipleship of Biblical counseling helps us to help others to identify what they are chasing instead of Jesus. \\xa0A faithful biblical counselor points out areas of false worship and helps a counselee to direct their worship toward Jesus Christ; as ACBC Fellow Dr. Ernie Baker says, “to become a worshiper of what truly matters.”\\n2. You need the information as much as your counselees do\\nWhen I decided to pursue certification, I was quite excited that I was going to be equipped to help other people to follow Jesus. From the first day of my first training weekend, however, I quickly realized that the biggest changes were going to need to be made in my own heart! That evening, I was both convicted and given hope in a few places where I truly needed it. It was wonderful. What do you struggle with? Are you anxious? Do you fear man more than you fear Him? Are you chasing approval, comfort, money, or fame? As you study and prepare to help others, the Lord will be working on your own heart through His Word.\\n3. We are ministers of the Word, not ministers of the world\\nAll Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. (ESV) 2 Timothy 3:16–17\\nThis is how God brings about change. He doesn’t need to throw ideas at a wall to see what sticks. He made us, he made our hearts, and He knows our frame. He loves us and has promised to make us more like Jesus (Rom 8:28-31). His Word speaks into every area to which our hearts love to run. It is He that has the sole authority to speak into our marriages, our parenting, our finances, our anxiety, our sexuality, our goals, etc. When people come to us for help, they do not need our opinions or the opinions of the world. They need the Word of God. They need the Gospel! I have sat down with multiple counselees this year and have had my heart broken by what secular counselors and even pastors have told them before they came to me. “My pastor friend said we should just give up on our marriage. He said it’s too far gone to save.” What an opportunity to shine the light of the Gospel into a broken, seemingly hopeless situation; an opportunity to teach these precious believers that their marriage is a beautiful representation of the union of Christ and His church (Ephesians 5:32).\\n4. You counsel every day; Do you do it well?\\nEvery time you engage in a conversation about life, people’s problems, or about the Lord and His Word, you are counseling. The reading, observations, instruction, exams, and supervision are all set up for you to learn to do this well. Counseling is done in private, and it can be difficult for us to gauge how it’s going. What are we doing right? What could we be doing better? ACBC consists of a network of like-minded Christ followers who are able to help and support you in your journey as a counselor. I have been blown away by the support and openness of other biblical counselors. Help and encouragement is truly just a text, call, or email away, and that is so helpful as I grow in this area of ministry.\\nThe ACBC certification process is rigorous but attainable.\\xa0 It’s also truly enjoyable. You will grow to know your Savior better as you grow in knowledge of His word. As you walk through the process, it’s like light bulbs start turning on with every page you read and every exam response you complete. You will find yourself using what you learn right away in conversations and various ministry situations, and that is truly a joyful experience. Let me encourage you to jump in or to jump back in to the process. This year will go by one way or another, what better way to spend it than by learning to help people to become worshipers of what truly matters?\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCertification\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Champagne is an ACBC certified member and Associate Pastor at Sunrise Community Church in Atlantic Beach, FL.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Ode to Supervision', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Keith Christensen', 'question': 'There are four main benefits of supervision: confirmation, oversight, instruction, and experience.', 'body': 'I am currently in the twilight hours of the third and final phase in the ACBC certification process: supervision. I’ve grown convinced of the profitability (I’m tempted to say “necessity”) of supervision while being equipped to counsel.\\nThere are four main benefits of supervision that have been especially important for me: confirmation, oversight, instruction, and experience. No doubt, there is significant overlap amongst this quartet of benefits. Nevertheless, they’re each worth examining in turn.\\nConfirmation\\nAren’t you glad that more than a written exam was required before you (and everyone else) received a driver’s license? It’s almost certain the simple requirement of supervised driving hours—together with a hands-on-the-wheel “driving test”—has literally saved people’s lives. We all see the need for a supervisor’s formal confirmation that one is “fit” to drive. Why? People’s lives are on the line. Albeit in a different sense, the task of counseling has similarly high stakes.\\nI have felt this great weight of responsibility inherent in formal counseling. Consequently, this benefit of ACBC’s certification process has been incredibly freeing for me: the supervision phase put the pressure on someone else (someone qualified) to decide if and when I am ready to be released into the world as a “safe” driver in the counseling room. More than that: your supervisor helps you get to that point.\\nOversight\\nThink about learning CPR as part of a first aid program. You must be equipped through various means like reading, lectures, exams, and even practicing the technique on a manikin. But after this foundation is laid, nothing could better equip you to perform CPR in the future than being forced to actually perform CPR on a real person who is really dying. Few of us would feel “competent to resuscitate” until we’ve actually resuscitated someone. Even fewer of us would want our first pass at CPR to occur without the oversight of one more experienced.\\nI still remember my first formal counseling session, when a man who was spiritually and emotionally “choking” came to me crying out for help. It made a big difference to know a supervisor was looking over my shoulder, ready for me to cry out for someone to help the helper.\\nInstruction\\nHow do you minister to a 60-year-old man who has had a decades-long battle with pornography, and his marriage is teetering on the edge of a cliff because of it? Writing an essay about what you would do and say to him is one thing (indeed, a very valuable thing). What you do and say to him while he is literally sitting in front of you is a different ballgame. Ink and paper abstractions can never quite replicate real-life, flesh and blood problems.\\nI needed the instruction I gained from Phases 1 and 2 of the ACBC certification process. Reading books, observing counseling sessions, listening to lectures, studying for exam questions, actually answering them (and being made to re-answer some of them): all of these things provided an invaluable foundationa. But applying these truths requires still another kind of instruction.\\nFor example, as my supervisor has watched over my counseling ministry, he has helped me identify several areas of counseling that I’m not particularly good at “naturally.” Not only do I now know that I need to make a concerted effort in these areas to compensate, he’s also given me some practical steps to help ensure I do.\\nTo add another example, I possess on my computer a 10-page (and growing!) document titled “Lessons Learned During Supervision.” As it stands now, it is a 58-point outline. Most points have numerous sub-points. Consider just the first three topics addressed: 1) How to deal with a counselee’s unclear testimony/articulation of the Gospel 2) What about people who cancel a lot? 3) How to maintain control of a data-gathering session with couples.\\nExperience\\nIt’s time to state the obvious. Supervision is the phase of certification where you accrue actual counseling experience. That’s good news all by itself. But it gets better; the supervision process actually multiplies the amount of experience you gain from those 50 hours of counseling.\\nJesus taught, “Everyone, when he is fully trained, will be like his teacher” (Luke 6:40). The one taught becomes conformed to the image of the one teaching. In some measure, the supervised will become like the supervisor. Discipleship always happens this way. Not through instruction only, but also through example and experience.\\nConsequently, supervision increases the rate at which you move from “one who counsels like he’s been doing it for weeks and months” toward “one who counsels like he’s been doing it for years and decades.” Your trajectory toward being an “experienced” counselor greatly accelerates, as the experiences of a truly experienced counselor vicariously become yours.\\nI’m deeply thankful to God for my supervisor’s investment in me and my ministry. There is no doubt I am a better minister of God’s Word and servant of God’s people because of it. And that means more than merely being better off as a counselor; I’m a better pastor, husband, parent, friend, and disciple because of it too.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCertification\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeith Christensen is ACBC certified and serves as preaching pastor at Christ Fellowship Bible Church in Fort Worth, TX.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Viewing the ACBC Exams as a Gift', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Will Cleland', 'question': 'When you view the exams as a God-given opportunity, you experience grace in the work of reading and writing.', 'body': 'When I looked at the requirements for the ACBC certification process I was intimidated particularly by the exams. For those of you who are also intimidated by the exams, I want to encourage you to set aside all thoughts of the ACBC exams being an intimidating task and instead begin thinking of them as a gift. It wasn’t until I made this transition from task to opportunity that I was able to experience the grace that was wrapped up in the tireless efforts of reading and writing. When viewed as an opportunity from God, studying Scripture and theological issues and applying them to everyday life results in this gift leading to a greater love for the Lord and a greater ability to faithfully minister the Word of God.\\nThe ACBC exams have benefited me personally and my ministry in two ways: theological foundation and practical application. This is how the exam is structured and this structure is in fact what has benefited me most.\\nTheological Foundation\\nRecently as I sat down with my pastor, I shared with him my desire to solidify my theological beliefs. Soon after I had this conversation, the ACBC exams were placed in front of me and I couldn’t view them as anything other than an opportunity. Studying theology requires that we take a topic and undergird that topic with biblical data. The ACBC exams challenged me to open up my Bible and solidify what I believe based on Scripture. These theological requirements were a tool that helped me saturate myself in the Word of God, resulting in a greater love for it and a greater ability to minister it.\\nPractical Application\\nWhile strengthening a theological foundation is a great benefit of taking these exams, it is not the end goal. I was amazed that the more I studied the Scriptures, the more practical and relevant the Scriptures became. While working on the counseling exam, I realized the theological foundations that I had been studying informed the way I thought through helping people with the problems that they face. Good theology is paired with practical application, so that it leads to loving both God and others.\\xa0\\nBenefits of This Opportunity\\nAs I mentioned earlier, the ACBC exams were a gift from the Lord in my life. The benefits have been so valuable, not only because they have helped me faithfully minister the Word of God in counseling, but because they have stirred me in a way that has challenged me to view everything in life through the lens of Scripture. By pursuing certification and completing the ACBC exams, I am now better equipped to minister the Word of God to counselees, my family, my youth group, and myself. If you are intimated by this process like I was, my prayer is that you too would begin to look at this process as a gift, and trust that through it you will be both better equipped to handle God’s Word and be changed in your love for it. If you become weary or intimidated during the certification process, meditate on the truth of Scripture below and remind yourself that the ACBC exams are a gift.\\nJames 1:17\\n“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCertification\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill Cleland is an ACBC certified member and Associate Pastor at Abner Creek Baptist Church.', 'source': 'url'}\n",
