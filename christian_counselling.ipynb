He has an M.Div from the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, he serves as an associate pastor at First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, he’s an ACBC-certified counselor with a specialization in marriage counseling. He’s also the author of three books: Letters to a Romantic, a whole series, one on dating, one on marriage, and one on the first years of marriage. He’s currently pursuing a PhD in Applied Theology and Sean and I are getting to work together on that wonderful project, which I’m thoroughly excited about and I pray that you will hear more about later as well. And then he’s focusing on a theology emphasis with biblical counseling here at Midwestern. So, Sean is married, he’s been married to Jenny for 10 years. They have two children. He is most passionate about the work of pastoral ministry, his family, and we shall not forget hot tea, which is a discussion that we have frequently. Sean, we both enjoy hot tea. He’s blessed by the sincere Christians of First Baptist Church and their passion for the Bible.\\nSean, it’s been really fun actually to watch you in pastoral ministry and to see how the Lord is using you there in Jacksonville among the saints there at First Baptist Church and I’m so grateful for you. So grateful for your time at ACBC, we had some overlap, which is really great. And I’m looking forward to our discussion this morning on this really important topic.\\xa0\\nSean Perron: Super glad to be here and I’m thankful for ACBC and all the work you’re doing Dale.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Well, I think we should clarify, Sean, the title of this podcast, I shouldn’t be asking if I personally should take the pill, but we want to give some perspective on this issue of the pill. I can remember honestly the first time in seminary where I even considered this idea was newly married, Summer and I had been married for just a little short while and we were in my Christian ethics class, and this topic came up about sexuality and then specifically with this issue of the pill as it relates to being an abortifacient, and there was this whole discussion and it has completely new on my heart and mind. And I remember going home and talking to Summer about some of these things. And man, it was just so intriguing and I’m so glad that you’re bringing this up. You’re writing a booklet on this as well. And we are releasing this at ACBC. So, I’m excited to talk about this topic. So let’s just jump right in. What makes the pill unique?\\xa0\\nSean Perron: Yeah, that is a crucial question. So, as we think about the pill, we need to think first and foremost about contraception in general. So, I think an accurate definition of contraception is against conception. So contraceptives prevent the sperm and the egg from ever uniting if they are true contraceptives. So, the pill gets complicated and is unique because it has features in it that are truly contraceptive, but it also has concerning elements as well, and that makes it more unique than say a typical barrier method that a husband and wife would use or a natural method, such as a calendar method. So it puts it in its own category, and specifically, the birth control pill has three primary mechanisms. So, in short summary, the first mechanism that the pill does is it prevents a woman from ovulating and thereby prevents conception, if she’s not ovulating then she cannot conceive a child. It also increases the mucous which does not permit the sperm and the egg to unite and so that it functions as a barrier method in that way, but the most significant portion for our discussion. The mechanism is it thins the lining of the uterus, which can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterine wall and then thereby preventing fertilized egg to live. It can’t continue to live if it can attach to the uterine wall, and it’s that third function of the pill, the weakening of that wall, which is very concerning because if a fertilized egg cannot implant, it will die. That last portion is an abortifacient, it is not just a contraceptive.\\nThe problem is we actually don’t know how often all three of those mechanisms work or fail, so to answer the dilemma is it helpful to know that every year 400 around 420 thousand babies are born despite their mothers taking the pill regularly and faithfully. So that’s 420,000 approximate children that are born and all three of those mechanisms failed in the process. So the pill was ineffective, even though it’s regularly taken and faithfully used children were still born. And so the question becomes, how often did the first two mechanisms fail that are truly contraceptive and the third mechanism, which is abortive work and thereby kill a child? Randy Alcorn is the first person that I came across who makes this argument and he says it is concerning whether or not one child is aborted by the pill. And we don’t know the answer, it could be 420,000. It could be double that number. It could be many more. The answer is we just don’t know but this puts the pill in a unique and complicated and dangerous category for contraceptives because it’s more than just a contraceptive.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah. So that’s absolutely what makes it unique and it’s concerning on some level with the stats that you just gave because if you’re following the discussion, It demonstrates that all three mechanisms are failing to some degree fairly consistently. And so we at least have to pay attention to that and logic would help us to understand that on some level maybe the first two mechanisms that you mentioned would fail and the third mechanism would not fail, well that brings it sort of in a moral category for us to have to discuss and talk about. Okay, what do we do? I talked about the birth control pill in premarital counseling because I want this young couple to really wrestle with this issue. They have to come to some conclusions and decisions that they’re making on their own about this because this becomes a moral issue. And so, the question naturally, arises is it biblically okay to take the pill?\\xa0\\nSean Perron:\\xa0That’s the question. So, we believe as we’re committed to the authority and sufficiency of the Word and that God alone is the giver and taker of life. So, there’s plenty of biblical passages that talk about this. So, 1 Samuel 2:6 talks about this, you have the biblical texts that talk about life beginning at conception. So you have Psalm 51:5. Psalm 139 is a classic beautiful psalm. You have other passages in the New Testament, like Luke 1:41 that talk about the preciousness and the value of life in the womb. And what this means is that the Bible teaches that life begins at the moment of conception and conception is when the sperm and the egg meet. And so, we have to say, okay, if there’s anything that’s snuffing out life, that’s killing life after conception, we have to take this seriously. And so that gets to the question of the pill, and I would say there are a few factors to think through.\\nSo, first, for single women, unmarried women who are not sexually active, this moral issue really is not an issue for them at their current stage of life. So the concerns, I’m raising here are only for women who are married or sexually active and who have a chance of conceiving or not conceiving, or but having the pill cause an abortion. So, if there’s a single woman who’s taking it, perhaps they’re taking it for some sort of medical help, maybe to have a more consistent cycle. If there’s a medical reason for it, and they’re single then this conversation is a different conversation and not this issue is not pressing.\\nThen you get to there’s a small minority of women who have life-threatening issues medical issues that the pill can help with. Actually, this was the camp that my wife fell into. So my wife went to the doctor and she had a medical issue and the doctor prescribed her the pill. And she was on the pill her whole life since getting this diagnosis. And then we got married, and then we had to come to the grips of what does this mean for us as a married couple? And it turns out her medical condition wasn’t truly life-threatening and she was able to get off the pill but we didn’t know. And so there was a season where she was on the pill and we actually had to use another means of birth control when she was ovulating. So we were under the impression from the doctor that she had to be on the pill for medical reasons. And so, biblical counselors, we value the life of the woman just as much as the life of the baby. And so we sought how can we protect the life of my wife and also protect the life of children. And so, our solution to that was using a barrier method during the time she was ovulating, but now in God’s kindness, we discovered that she doesn’t have to be on the birth control pill or her medical issue. And so we’re very thankful for that. But I say all that to say the answering of the question is complex, so if you’re single, this issue is not relevant. If you have a medical condition, you have to answer it a bit differently than you would without that medical condition. But at the end of the day, we as Christians have to agree that protecting the unborn, protecting the life of children is crucial. And it is very important, and we must take it seriously. And I believe that that rules out the pill as a means of birth control. So, if someone is saying, I’m going to use the pill as a means of birth control, I would say that is a dangerous, unwarranted plea, unbiblical decision that the couple is undertaken.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, that’s right. Well said, Sean, and I think I want you to pay attention listeners to the way in which Sean is dealing with a very complex, complicated, multi-layered issue. He is starting with a theological truth, right? The fact that we are passionate about life because our God gives life and takes life away. He’s the Creator. That’s how we understand Him, and then we work out the particulars from that theological doctrine, as we deal with the multi-layered dilemmas that we see unfolding specific to an issue that a woman might be undergoing and that sort of thing. And so, we have this truth that our practice flows out of if you will. And so pay attention to the way he’s dealing with that. Now he mentioned that this was complex, it is complex, I’m going to dive down just a little bit in one of those areas of complexity. Let’s say, for example, you have a lady who has been taking the pill for a long time, what do we do in situations like that Sean?\\nSean Perron: This issue we have to admit that the church at large has not done a great job at addressing this issue. When I’ve talked to people about this, when people first encounter this, were Christians, godly couples encounter this information, often times they’re shocked to hear this, often times they went to their doctor and their doctor believe that life began at implantation instead of conception. And so their doctor who might have been even been a Christian was able to, in their conscience prescribed the pill knowing all the scientific facts, knowing all the details that I just described. None of that is in dispute. You can read the labels on everything. The science is very clear on this. The debate often happens with the interpretation of whether or not life begins at conception or implantation, and I believe the Scripture is very clear it’s conception. The American Academy of Pediatrics also just came out recently with a very helpful and detailed report about, they also believe it’s related to conception where life begins. And so, you have Christians that were either told one thing by their medical professionals, and that was an interpretive decision and not actual scientific reality, or their medical position may be as a general practitioner, they didn’t know, they weren’t asking the right questions, and this is a shock.\\nA few things we need to say about that: first and foremost, we never need to be afraid of the truth. The Bible says, the truth shall set us free, and that truth is found ultimately in Jesus Christ. He is the way, the truth, and the life. The Bible says, sanctify them by Your Word. Your word is truth. So Christians are not afraid of the truth, we’re not scared of it, and so the more truth that we can discover that’s a help and that is a benefit and not a scary thing. And so, the question then becomes, what do we do? What does a couple do? Who’s maybe, perhaps been on the birth control pill as their primary means of birth control for a long time and they did not know this a few things. So, one, we truly don’t know what we don’t know. So for that couple, it’s quite possible that they during that sexual intercourse over the course of years there may have been abortions that have taken place that they did not know about. It’s also possible that in God’s kindness and God’s sovereignty every single time, the first mechanism of the pill worked, and it was a contraceptive, and no abortions took place. But the reality is we don’t know and because we don’t know, that requires us to trust in the Lord, to trust in His goodness, to trust in His sovereignty, trust in His kindness to us, and to trust in His forgiveness, the Bible does say that were held accountable for unknown sins that’s all over the Scripture. That’s in Leviticus chapter 4; it’s in Numbers chapter 15, that’s even in Luke chapter 12:47-48. We are held accountable for sins and actions that we didn’t even know we were doing. And that’s not bad news in the ultimate sense. It is bad news in one sense, but it leads us to the good news that Jesus Christ loves and forgives every known and unknown sin for anyone who repents, and who anyone who trusts in him alone. And so I would say, the good news of the Gospel is the answer to this question.\\nSo, the good news is that Jesus lived a perfect life. He died on the cross for sinners, He rose from the dead to provide salvation for everyone who would turn from their sins and trust in Him. And the couple who is jarred by this information, the solution is to run to Christ and to His comfort and His love and His cross and His forgiveness and trust in Him. And in addition to that, now that they know this information, to act differently. So now that they know this information to change and that gets to the heart of the issue, and heart issue is why would a couple knowing this information continue to use the birth control pill as their primary means of birth control? Is it a matter of convenience? Is it a matter of denial? Is it a matter of this is a personal private issue, and we don’t want God intervening in our personal and our marriage bed? And all of those issues fall flat, and all those issues fall short of the biblical standard, and we can glorify God in our marriage bed. We can glorify God with our decisions related to this topic and that’s where bearing fruit in keeping with repentance is crucial.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Amen, well said there as well. A personal and quick testimony after we, Summer and I found out about this information, I wanted to do some research on my own and so we did that while we were in seminary and we were so burdened by this, we wanted to take this information to her OB and even as you mentioned I think you have you know well-intentioned physicians. But as I brought this information to her OB, I mean, she responded not favorably at all and actually quite vehement against what I was saying and did not try to affirm what was clearly laid out in science, and was really sort of appalled that we would even raise this question. It was a really interesting conversation, but we left that place even being more convicted over what the truth of Scripture says versus what we were reading about in science. And so it moved us in the direction and happily, we have six children now, and we’re so grateful for that. And so, the Lord is very kind and very good in these ways.\\nNow, I want to revisit one of the things that you brought up a little earlier relative to some of the complexity that surrounds this issue of the pill itself, particularly as it relates to medical conditions. So what do we do about married women who have medical conditions that require the pill because we’re talking about multi-layer things here, right? She doesn’t fit the category that you mentioned earlier in singleness and so on. So now she’s married. We’re wanting to encourage she and her spouse to engage and biblically faithful sexual relationship and that sort of thing. So what advice do we give to her?\\nSean Perron: A couple of things. So the Bible does care deeply about the life of the mom, the life of the wife, and also the medical illnesses that she’s dealing with. And so that is not to be taken lightly; the Scripture takes that very seriously, and the question then becomes, okay, is there a way to protect both the life of the mom and the wife and the life of her children and of the conceived babies in the womb? And I really believe the answer is yes. So, I don’t think we have to pick between the life of the woman and the life of the child.\\nFor example, if a woman is actually on the pill for medical reasons, their cycle is trackable in a way that is even more so for women who aren’t on the pill oftentimes. It’s predictable, and you can know when you’re ovulating, it’s very easy to do that, what that means is a couple who should regularly have sex and be faithful to that, they can know when the woman is ovulating, and they can plan accordingly to use a biblical contraceptive, a barrier method for that time. So that could be condoms, that could be a diaphragm. That could be, there’s a variety of options that they could use the one thing I will note that’s important, and it’s going a little technical here, but it’s crucial to the issue is sperm can live inside a woman for up to five days. And so what that means is, when you’re calculating this, you need to calculate for margin on your timetable here. So it’s not just like, oh, I’m ovulating today, and now we can use a barrier method. Well, the lead-up to that if you were having sexual intercourse the day before, or even two days or three days up to five days beforehand, the sperm can live. And then what you want to do is you want to prevent the possibility of murdering a child and the possibility of a child dying. And so, I would recommend strongly to plan accordingly margin on each side, given what we know about signs, and given the account that sperm can live up to 5 days in advance. So, I hope that’s just a couple of practical tips, but I hope that’s helpful in knowing that you don’t have to choose between the life of the woman and the life of the child. You can honor God, glorify Him, and protect both.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0All this discussion makes me really excited to read the booklet that you and your wife Jenny wrote together that’s a part of our Biblical Solution Series. So thank you brother, for attacking this issue with kindness, with grace, with biblical wisdom as we understand what science is telling us about these matters. And so thank you, brother, for dealing with these in a very nuanced, complex, but biblically faithful Way.

She’s been a certified counselor with ACBC since 2015. She’s a public speaker and author whose testimony reaches out to those who are desperately seeking hope and healing from their own personal tragedies. Camille has a passion to help others realize that our deepest needs can only be met through the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the truth of His Word. She’s ministered to women of all ages for over 20 years as a post-abortion trauma and crisis counselor. She holds a bachelor’s degree in communication studies with social issues focus. Camille and her husband, Troy, have three adult children and reside in the Cincinnati, Ohio, metro area.\\nAnd today, you’re going to find out about that passion as we talk to Camille about this issue of counseling abortion-minded couples. I just want to, first of all, welcome Camille. I’m so grateful for your ministry here, even talking at this past year’s Annual Conference and giving your testimony. A transparent testimony about the faithfulness of our Lord. Thank you for that, and thank you for being here today.\\xa0\\nCamille Cates: Thank you for having me, Dale.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0All right, so we’re just going to jump right in the first question for you here as we discuss how to counsel and care for abortion-minded couples. What do you think are some of the most important things to consider? Because let me preface it by saying this, sometimes, even when we know deep difficulty has happened, we have a tendency to fear, we’re hindered by that fear or ignorance of I’ve never experienced anything like this. I’m not sure how to engage this. So, how do we engage and care for those who are abortion-minded to talk about such a sensitive difficult issue?\\xa0\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0I would say that it’s most important to consider the hearts of everyone involved. And by that, I mean the heart of the counselor, the heart of the church who is supporting the counseling, and of course, the heart of the counselee.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I want to dive in a little bit more cause I think you’re pinpointing this issue of the heart, and so, share more about how we consider the heart of the counselor?\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0Sure, when counseling an abortion-minded woman or couple, the counselor must consider whether or not they have the time and the energy it takes to counsel and coordinate the care of this woman or couple. There’s a lot involved in counseling those who are abortion-minded. Does the counselor have a heart that is committed to them for the long haul? We all probably realize there is not a set amount of time that It takes to work with the counselee, but I think many counselors would say the standard amount of time it takes walking with someone through counseling is around three to six months, depending on the situation. But for crisis counseling, it takes more time. So, for instance, crisis counseling in pregnancy realistically would last nine months or a year or more. That’s a long time, and it requires a serious time commitment. I mean, we counselors have families, and we have other responsibilities. So, it’s really important to set some things aside, and it’s important to remember that the lives that we are counseling are really literally on the line here. There’s life on the line. So, this is a unique form of crisis counseling.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, I want you to go a little bit deeper here. As we think about counseling abortion-minded couples, this is obviously prior to an abortion; they’re considering what’s going on. You mentioned being willing to engage for the long haul. So, I want you to tell us a little bit more about why these types of situations are quite intense emotionally; people are going through a lot when they’re considering these things and why they require a longer timeframe for counseling.\\xa0\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0Well, counselors need to understand that most abortion-minded couples are operating in that mindset because they know that they can’t do this alone. They realized that, and they may feel like they don’t have a means of support. So, if you’re only going to commit to spending three to six months in counseling with them, that’s a kind of the counselor’s normative time frame. They may feel abandoned or fall back into crisis mode, or even be tempted to bitterness. They might think, “this counselor really only wanted to get them past the point of having an abortion,” or they may be tempted to seek an abortion even later in their pregnancy because they no longer have strong support as the pregnancy becomes more difficult or thoughts of caring for the baby or making an adoption plan become very overwhelming to them. In other scenarios, such as a health crisis with the baby and maybe even the mother, they will need counseling care throughout the entire pregnancy and beyond. With each doctor’s appointment, as she hears more bad news, and negative news, she will be likely updated on the poor prognosis of her baby, which can send her into a tailspin of wrong thinking or deep grief.\\nSo, counselors must remember that our counseling and care extends beyond someone choosing not to abort their baby. The single woman or a couple may be facing long-term and expensive medical care for a child with a disability that will be for the rest of the parents’ lives. Perhaps their doctor is saying the baby will not likely live to term or will die shortly after he or she is born. So, these are heavy, heavy burdens of the soul to carry around day after day for months. And she’s carrying and sensing this baby that’s moving within her womb, and she’s knowing that the possibility of death is impending. If there was trauma around the pregnancy, such as rape or incest, or an abusive partner, she’s carrying a heavy mental and emotional burden, which could affect her physically then as well.\\nSo, these women are carrying a lot, and many times they need daily or every other day counsel. That’s a lot on our load as counselors, and they need care. So not just a weekly counseling appointment with assigned homework. Sometimes they’re not even really mentally capable of doing regular homework assignments for counseling because they’re so stressed mentally and emotionally. So as the counselor, you may need to spend your time on the phone or meeting with them in person to read Scripture with them to help them have that focused attention that they need on the Word. It’s almost like spoon-feeding someone who’s very ill. So, spiritually speaking, they may be barely hanging on. And as you can see, these types of counseling situations need a serious commitment from the counselor.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, when we talk about that serious commitment, that may mean we reduce counseling load because this is just taking a little bit more effort, a little bit more time, a little bit more intensity, and the counselor, you know, doesn’t need to bear this load alone, that’s the importance of the church and the heart of the church. I’ve heard you talk about that in the past. Tell us a little bit about what you mean when you talk about the heart of the church and helping support cases like this.\\xa0\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0So, the heart of the church is important because our counselees often need intensive care while we’re providing the counsel. So, if you think about a woman who’s chosen life for her baby, even though she’s been given a difficult health prognosis for the baby or even for her, she may need to be on bed rest at some point. How is she going to do her laundry, clean her house, fix meals for her family, and take care of other children that are in the home? What if she had to quit work and she doesn’t have enough income to make rent? If she’s single, how is she going to do that on her own? So as the counselor, we’re operating as the part of the body of Christ that is helping her with her spiritual needs, but with some of the scenarios that I’ve shared with you, you can see that require some pretty heavy lifting. So, counselors need the support of others in the church to help them with the practical care and the physical needs of their counselees, which also has some pretty heavy lifting to it.\\nSo, is the heart of your church one where others are committed to providing intensive care as you counsel? When doing crisis counseling, it helps to know that we aren’t alone as the counselors in caring for our counselees either; just like the abortion-minded woman or couple needs to know they’re not alone, the counselor needs to know they’re not alone either. So my personal belief is that there really needs to be more care teams in our churches to support counselees and their counselors. I love how the New Living Translation words, Ecclesiastes 4:12, which states, “a person standing alone can be attacked and defeated but two can stand back-to-back and conquer, three are even better for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.” That’s a great picture of how the church needs to view ministry to those who we are counseling.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I love this emphasis. You’ve talked about the heart of the counselor, you’ve included the church, and let me just say it flatly that if the church really cares about this issue, we’re going to have to engage it tangibly, not just give lip service to it and giving ascent that we care about the unborn. We’re going to have to put some effort, some resources, some time, some people to engage abortion-minded couples that I think is really critical for us, and this is a tangible way where the rubber is going to meet the road, whether we really are pro-life or not, whether we really care about the unborn child and the lady who’s carrying this child, are we going to care well for them to remove some of those hindrances and fears that she might have that’s leading her, causing her to be lured and enticed in this direction of being abortion-minded. And we talked about the heart of the counselor. We talked about the heart of the church, which I think are all important. We’ve even set this up for you as listeners as you engage abortion-minded couples to understand sort of what surrounds everything in their life, the scenario, how to gather data well and consider all the things on the exterior.\\nAnd now, we need to pinpoint the heart of the counselee. How do we now focus? How can we, as counselors, provide biblical counsel to abortion-minded counselees?\\nCamille Cates: Yeah, of course, there’s no formulaic answer here, but there are some strong pro-life passages to counsel from. It may seem kind of obvious, but Psalm 139 really is one of the most poignant passages in Scripture on the issue of life, and not just the life of the baby in utero, but the lives of the mom and dad too. The abortion-minded counselee is often more worried about themselves, their current situation and what having a baby will do to their future. So, I would encourage counselors to sit down with their counselees and really walk through Psalm 139 1-12, focusing on who God is, His attributes that are showcased in that passage, how they apply to the Psalmist, and then bring it home with application to the counseling and their situation.\\nFirst, these verses talk about God’s vast knowledge, show your counselee from Scripture that God knows every thought they have, every word they speak before they even speak it, and the path that they are on. He knows it all. He is all-knowing, which means He knows exactly what every day of their pregnancy and beyond that is going to look like. They can trust Him to carry them through and to provide for their needs. Psalm 139:10 speaks to God’s presence. His omnipresence with us through it all. The counselor can expound on this and help the counselee to apply it to their situation specifically. You could even go so far as to say His omnipotence as being all-powerful is displayed in this passage, especially when you consider verses 13 through 18.\\nWalk the abortion-minded couple through the implications and application of God knitting their baby together in their mother’s womb. Even if there’s a disability, God uses imperfect human DNA; it’s flawed because of the curse of sin, but He is still the master artist, and He uses those threads of DNA, weaving them together to create new little image bearers within their mothers’ wombs. God is this master artisan weaving, knitting, and forming human beings together just the way He wants us to be, all for His glory and our good. Additional Scriptures that are helpful to the counselee when an abnormality is discovered in her pregnancy, I think of Exodus 4:11, God’s very famous dialogue with Moses about man’s physical abilities and disabilities, and John 9, where Jesus refers to a blind man who was born that way, that the works of God might be displayed in him. What a great chapter to walk through with a counselee. This man’s story of giving Jesus glory all happened because he had been born disabled.\\nStill, I would caution counselors while the word of God does powerfully transform the heart, we must also consider the practical everyday struggles of parents who are caring for children with disabilities. Make sure that our counsel thought right and true doesn’t come across as insensitive or ignorant of their personal needs. We must commit our support to them as the church. What a testimony to the world when we care for the abortion-minded with a love of Christ beyond their choice to keep their baby because that is what the culture is. Accusing Christians of right now, getting a woman to choose life for her baby rather than abortion. But then abandoning her to care for her baby on our own. The church can show the world that is not true and that we are committed to the care of those we counsel because the love of Christ compels us.\\nDale Johnson: Camille, listen, this has been so helpful, you’ve helped us think well in the past about post-abortive care, our reaction to abortion when a lady follows through with that, and the devastation she must feel and how we can approach that in counseling. What you’ve done today is help to turn the tables and the focus, even a little bit more, on proactive, preventive care, how we tangibly are the hands and feet of the Lord Jesus, as the body of Christ to engage in those who are at such a difficult moment and feeling so unsettled and us using ourselves in the lives of other, using the church to be tangibly the feet of the hands and feet of Jesus. Camille, listen, this has been so helpful. Thank you so much for helping us to think proactively in this way as well.\\xa0\\nCamille Cates: My pleasure, Dale.\\n\\nHelpful Resources:\\n2023 ACBC Exhibiting Schedule\\nBooklet: Post-Abortive Counseling: Ministering Biblical Hope After Abortion by Camille Cates\\nDispelling the Darkness of Abortion with the Light of Christ – Annual Conference message\\nCounseling Abortion-Minded Women – Annual Conference message\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbortion\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCamille Cates is the Assistant Director of Healing Hearts Ministries International.

She is the assistant director of Healing Hearts Ministry. You’re going to hear a little bit more about that ministry, but before we get to talking about the ministry, Camille, welcome to the podcast. We’re looking forward to having you share today.\\nCamille Cates: Thanks for having me, Dale.\\nDale Johnson: Today, what I want to do is to have Camille share a little bit about her testimony, and I want this to be an encouragement to our members in a couple of different directions. Sometimes as counselors, we see situations that we find are simple biblical solutions, easy things to work through. Then there are often times where we encounter difficulty, deep struggle, deep tragedy even. Sometimes we wonder, “Lord, how in the world can we minister?” And sometimes we’re afraid that maybe the Word of God isn’t powerful enough to help in situations like this. I want Camille to be able to share with you today a piece of her story so that we can be encouraged about the beauty of God’s Word and the deep hope that we can find in His Word. Camille, welcome, and I’d love to hear a little bit more about your story.\\nCamille Cates: My story begins, I was a church-raised kid, I grew up in the church, heard a lot about the Bible and Bible stories, people from the Bible, but I would say I didn’t have a whole lot of application growing up. I did come to know the Lord at age 12 at a youth camp. But when I went back home, I just didn’t have the discipleship. I was lacking the discipleship at home. By the time I got into high school, something that I had really\\xa0struggled with, now I see as idolatry, then I just saw as guys that I thought were interesting and wanted a relationship so badly. I began dating and I actually became sexually active at the age of 15. Before long, I became pregnant at 16, almost 17 years old.\\nI remember my mom coming to me and asking me if I wanted to have an abortion, which shocked me as a Christian teen. I knew that I shouldn’t be having sex outside of marriage. I knew that was wrong, but I knew abortion was also wrong and in my heart and mind I wasn’t going to cross that line. So, I told my mom, “No, I want to keep this as my baby. I want to keep my baby.” My parents were so gracious and loving and said, “We’ll support you.” And they did faithfully, but my heart hadn’t changed at all during that time. Again, I was lacking in discipleship at that point of crisis.\\nSo, I just kept doing life. I had my daughter, and that relationship did not work out. It was just my daughter, me, and my parents helping me, and I was still looking for a relationship. That’s what I thought was the answer and what I needed, what I wanted, and chased after. I found another relationship, got into that relationship, quickly became sexually active, and quickly became pregnant again.\\nLooking back, it’s always interesting to see our view of God and His Word. We’re tempted to change that based on our changing circumstances. I love now knowing God’s Word, that His Word is unchanging. He is unchanging, His character is unchanging, but I didn’t understand that at that point. I began to question and think about an abortion. In the course of events, I never really came to that decision. The boyfriend and I stayed together. We became engaged and thought that we might get married. I didn’t know what we would do at that point with the unexpected pregnancy.\\nOne night, he was watching my daughter for me and I was at work. My mom came up to my work and said, “You’ve got to come to the hospital. Something’s happened to Lauren (my daughter).” Through the course of the evening, we found out that he had sexually assaulted and shaken her to death, and I was still pregnant with his baby. My parents had known about the pregnancy. Before we had even left the hospital, they were pressuring me to have an abortion. With my world wrought through tragedy, because I didn’t have the solid ground in God’s Word and who He was in the midst of my tragedy, I made the decision to have an abortion four days after we buried my daughter.\\nA lot of people talk about the downward spiral and that’s how my life went, dealing with the pain and the hurt in my own sin, and being sinned against, and it was just all a big mess. I did what I knew to do at that time and got involved in more relationships. Because of the depth of the tragedy, I think I opened myself up to even more depraved things than I had participated in before. I kind of lived with the motto: whatever with whoever whenever. I see a lot of that in our culture today and my heart goes out because I know people are reeling from sin, their own sin, and sin done against them.\\nThe Lord in His kindness helped me to become sick of my own sin at one point and brought me back to my hometown and brought a young man into my life. He had graduated from seminary and was headed into youth ministry as a youth pastor. He graciously shared with me at one point that he knew about my abortion. I didn’t think he knew, and he said, “Camille, I love you in spite of your abortion and I want to be with you anyway.” It freaked me out a little bit, and I was just like, “Okay, well I have to go,” and I left.\\nThe Lord in His Word and the truth of the Gospel came back to me so clearly that night because I saw an example of it. That the Lord knows that we’re sinners, depraved as can be, but He loves us, and He sent his Son because He wants to be with us anyway. That was a turning point in my life where I didn’t want the idolatry of relationships anymore. I knew I needed to re-engage with my relationship with Christ. I had a godly man that was pursuing me, whom I married, and he began to disciple me and I grew. Being in youth ministry we’re exposed to a lot of good teaching, so I grew.\\nBut I still have this abortion and my past. Sometimes when we as counselors are dealing with marriage cases where it’s communication, or finances, or they’re just not loving one another well, we do a disservice to our counselees when we don’t ask the good questions. “Do you have an abortion in your past? Do you have sexual abuse in your past?” Because those are deep hurts and sin. There’s a lot of shame and condemnation that covers over those things. That’s really sometimes at the root. If we would help our counselees get to God’s Word and the healing offered there, we would find that they would then learn God’s Word teaches also about how to love well in my marriage and how to communicate in a Christ-like way.\\nA lot of times, we have really great Christian leaders in our churches that are trying to run with a spiritual limp because of their past. My abortion was rocking my marriage. It just seemed to dominate my desire to have a child, and then I lived under a common fear for a lot of post-abortive men and women—that God was going to punish me and not let me have children again. That is not what we see from His Word. We know that sometimes, that is a natural consequence. As a ministry with Healing Hearts, we talk in our Bible study about how there are natural consequences, but Christ takes our punishment on the cross when we put our hope and our faith in Him to cover all our sins.\\nGod graciously brought me to Healing Hearts in 1998 and I went through their post-abortion study for women called Binding up the Brokenhearted. It is so gospel-centered and Scripture rich that the Word of God transformed every area of my life, not just my abortion. I found some hope and some healing for my marriage as well. Being through that study, I loved God’s Word. I believe it’s Psalm 107:20 that says, “He sent his word and healed them, and delivered them from all of their destructions,” and that was true when I got finished with the Bible study. It gave me a hunger and a thirst for God’s Word. I began to say, “What else does this book have in it?” Because it does hold everything we need for life and godliness. That’s when I came on board and started serving with the ministry back in 1998-99. I’m thankful that God has used that and used His Word continually in my life. It’s the key for how to live a godly life and be conformed to Christ’s image.\\nDale Johnson: As I listen to you tell your story, it’s constantly convincing me that the Bible, in every word that it says, is absolutely true. If you look at the beginning of your life, and we all experienced this when we disobey what God says, the consequences are monumental. Not just in actions and deeds, but also in emotions, in the baggage that we carry from all of those experiences. The Scriptures warned us in those ways, and it proves true even in our own sin.\\nBut as we turn the corner in the Lord through His Spirit, and His Word begins to work in our hearts, it begins to prove true even more that it’s more powerful in overcoming all of that difficulty in the tragedy that we experience in life. What Jesus says is true, that He has given us His Word to overcome the things in the world and He that is in us is greater than he that’s in the world. As I hear your testimony, I’m just super encouraged about the ministry of the Word and the work of the Spirit and what He can do in the hearts and lives of people who are broken.\\nYou mention one of the things for us to look for as counselors is we have a lot of people—especially as we know our statistics are growing relative to sexual abuse and physical abuse and post-abortive care—as we see those numbers increase, more and more of our counselees are going to have that issue or one of those issues in their past. What are some of the typical things as people try to push those experiences down, or forget those experiences, or move beyond, what are the ways that you see that baggage in people? The experiences that they have, or the actions that they do, or things that they say that counselors can be looking for to help people work through.\\nCamille Cates: For a lot of people, anger and fear are the two big ones. Really walking through when you’ve been sinned against, there is such a thing as righteous anger. I think we don’t talk about it a lot or enough. Our Bible studies really help counselees discern, “Do I have righteous anger? Am I angry over what God would be angry over? Is it okay to grieve that I’ve been sinned against grievously?” But then be taught how not to sin in their anger. Otherwise, they’re just walking around with anger and bitterness and unforgiveness in their hearts and they don’t know sometimes why or how to deal with it. Sometimes we can just say, “It’s a sin to be angry.” Well, that’s not necessarily what the Bible says. It says we can sin in our anger, but anger in and of itself, if it’s righteous, is not sin. If it’s self-centered, then yes. Really helping your counselee discern that. If you see that they’re —they’re angry in their marriage, they’re angry in their parenting—they might have an abortion or sexual abuse in their past.\\nFear is the other. It’s indicative that there might be something that somebody is struggling with. Sometimes anxiety and depression, those kinds of symptoms of the heart come out. So, making sure that, as counselors, we’re asking those good questions and giving them the good framework from God’s Word about His design for sexuality. Again, we should grieve that it’s broken if we’ve been sinned against in that way. It’s okay to grieve that. If we’ve sinned against others in that way, there’s hope through Christ. We can confess, we can repent, we can receive God’s forgiveness.\\nOne way that we talk about in our studies that is a common worldly way of dealing with sin is self-forgiveness. That’s just not biblical, and it seems like every post-abortive man or woman that we minister to at the beginning of our counseling time with them, we hear them say, “I just can’t forgive myself.” We know that we’re going to go to God’s Word and say, “Yeah, you can’t forgive yourself. It’s not biblical. Are you really receiving Christ’s forgiveness?” Sometimes there’s pride, the pride of self-righteousness. “I’ve messed up, now I have to clean myself up,” which is a lie those counselees are hanging onto. We need to help them see that Christ is the only one who can redeem and renew and restore. We’ve got to put our hope in what His finished work on the cross has done for us.\\nDale Johnson: Right, that is exactly the issue we’re talking about, self-forgiveness. It’s an issue of unbelief. The Scriptures never require us to do that. It doesn’t call us to do that, in part, because we don’t have the ability nor power to do that. This is God’s work that He does in us through Christ, and He’s just asking us to believe in the work of Christ. That’s a great point and several healthy symptoms I think we can look through. What I want to do now if we can, the last part that we have together, is tell us a little bit about Healing Hearts Ministries and some of the resources that you guys offer that ministered to you and that I know will be helpful in ministry to others.\\nCamille Cates: Even though we started out as a post-abortion trauma ministry 30 years ago, God has broadened our discipleship materials since then. We do offer a post-abortion study for men and one for women. We also offer a study for women that we use to help counsel on issues like sexual abuse and domestic violence, different issues of the heart, and that’s called the Hem of His Garment. All of our adult resources can be found at our website healinghearts.org under the Get Help Now tab. You can either find a trained leader in your area to work with you through that study one-on-one, or you can sign up and we actually offer the Bible study online with what we call an e-counselor that we’ll pair up with you to walk with you through this study.\\nWe also have some youth resources. Our teenagers need these answers from the beginning. They’re struggling with the same issues at 13, 15, 19. So we have some new youth resources we’d love for people to check out.\\nDale Johnson: Camille we’re so grateful that you’re with Healing Hearts and the work that you guys do. I’m so thankful to hear even more about this ministry and your connection to the local church and your desire to invigorate and equip the local church to do this very important work of the ministry, to work with those who are broken, and to demonstrate that God’s Word is helpful even in the most difficult of situations.

      "{'title': 'Forgiveness After an Abortion', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 32', 'author': 'Amy Evenson  Heath Lambert  Julie Ganschow', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Abortion 8', 'question': 'What are some biblical and practical ways of ministering to women who have had abortions?', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: One of the topics that has overtaken our cultural consciousness in the aftermath of the Planned Parenthood scandal is the issue of caring for women who are considering an abortion or who have had an abortion. This is a topic that is dear and precious to my heart because it is important to me that Christians be caring for women who are being destroyed by a culture of death that endorses abortion on demand.\\nOne of the things that nobody talks about is the fact that when women have an abortion they will incur guilt, and many of them will feel this guilt. They will begin to feel the need for forgiveness pressing in on them. This is an issue we have to address because so many of us know these women. Some of you are these women. We need to minister to one another so we can know what forgiveness looks like in the aftermath of a sin like an abortion. So I have invited Julie Ganschow to be our guest this week on Truth in Love. Julie is an ACBC certified counselor and has many years of counseling experience. This week Amy Evenson sat down and talked with her about the crucial topic of guilt after abortion.\\nAmy Evenson: In the aftermath of an abortion there is so much emotion and heartache; even years after the abortion has taken place. What would you say to a woman who thinks God can’t forgive her after her abortion?\\nJulie Evenson: As biblical counselors, our primary mission is to give the gospel of Jesus Christ to those who are lost and dying in their sin. And to bring help, healing, and hope to those who are broken and ruined because of their sin. I can think of no greater group of people more in need of help, healing, and hope than those who are post-abortive. What I would say to a woman who thinks God cannot forgive her for her abortion is this: “What I want you to know is God is a forgiving God. And yes, he can and does forgive the sin of abortion.” So many women are living with a past abortion that haunts their present life. There are women who have been suffering, in some cases, with post-abortion effects for decades. The greatest number of women having abortions are in the 19-24 year-old age range. These women typically wait 7-10 years before reaching out for any help after their abortions. Many times they live for decades with the pain and the agony of post-abortive problems.\\nKnowing this has made me much more aware on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights. As I look around my church, I am wondering how many of these dear women are locked in a world that is full of guilt and fear and shame; terrified that if they were to die on the way home they would be unforgiven for their abortions. These women are living under the kind of shame and condemnation that I don’t think someone who hasn’t\\xa0experienced an abortion can really understand. In a biblical post-abortion counseling ministry, the women typically come from one of two groups and each has their own unique spiritual problem.\\nThe first group are women who had abortions before becoming Christians and the second group are women who had abortions as Christians. I think this is difficult for us to understand, that Christian women do have abortions. One million women each year in the US have an abortion. 200,000 of them are bible believing Christian women. That means 1 in every 5 women who have an abortion identifies herself as a born again evangelical, charismatic, or fundamentalist Christian. And for a variety of reasons these women think they have no other choice than to end their pregnancy. As the church we need to be prepared to help women from both groups work through all the issues that result from the abortion decision. Including the fear that God will not forgive them for what they’ve done.\\nI think two of the biggest issues that all post-abortive women struggle with are guilt and fear. Both of these are directly connected to God and being forgiven by God. We believe that dealing with the guilt goes beyond dealing with just the guilty feelings. Guilty feelings are a typical result of sinning against God or man, and we believe that a post-abortive woman has to deal with the real guilt that goes beyond just how she feels. In most cases, having an abortion is at the end of a long train of sinful decisions. So she has to begin by biblically addressing the things that lead to the pregnancy. Things such as being sexually immoral, lying to her parents or authority figure, perhaps lying to the boy or man with who she conceived the child. Chances are that she is making selfish decisions or is simply living a duplicitous life; acting one way in front of her church friends and family and then another way in the private areas of her life.\\nShe is also going to have to deal with the real guilt that comes from ending the baby’s life. And with that guilt comes fear. Most post-abortive women are often very fearful of being judged by God for what they’ve done. They fear God’s punishment, His retribution, going to Hell, having future children being born maimed or disfigured, or even having children die as some sort of divine punishment against them for having an abortion. I think most of all they fear having to live with a secret of this magnitude for the rest of their lives. All of these things go into her belief that God can’t possibly forgive her. She thinks, “I’ve done this thing, it’s unforgivable.” And I honestly don’t think the church helps itself. We do not help post-abortive women as the church. Many churches are very vocal about abortion being murder and many pastors will stand up in front of their churches on Sunday, particularly during the pro-life season (which tends to be around the fall of the year) and they will pound on the pulpit and talk about murdering your baby. The post-abortive woman who is already dealing with all of this guilt and all of this fear and shame thinks to herself, “There is no way I’m going to these people for help. All I would get is condemnation and I’ve got enough of that already.” She believes if humans can’t forgive her, then there is no way a holy and perfect God could forgive her for what she has done.\\nNow the woman who is not a Christian, of course, fears going to Hell because of what she has done. I have to agree that the unsaved woman is in a perilous place, but not only because of her abortion. She needs to know that it is possible to resolve all of her guilt and free herself from any divine judgment by God just like everyone else: she has to believe the gospel by faith. She has to believe that Jesus is the son of God, that he died on the cross for her sin, and that he rose again on the third day according to the Scriptures. She has to accept and believe by faith that there is forgiveness – even for the sin of abortion. When a woman has an abortion as a\\xa0Christian, she doesn’t really understand how God could forgive her. Especially when she knows what she knows: about grace and mercy and what God thinks of abortion. And yet, she had one anyway.\\nThese are women that are really fearful that there is no forgiveness available to them. Sometimes they say, “I’m sure God has revoked my salvation. How could I do this knowing what I know?” But we have to help her and all women understand that while abortion is a horrible sin, it is a forgivable sin. All post-abortive women need to hear that, Yes God has found her guilty for her abortion. As well as every other sin. And in Christ justice has been served. God has accepted the payment of Christ’s blood for the blood she spilled in having an abortion. And Christ’s sacrifice is sufficient for all her sin. The past, present, and even the future sin (including the stuff we haven’t even thought of yet.) The blood of Christ covers our sin. I think this is critical for her to understand: that her sin is forgivable in Christ. As a sinner she must repent and she must run to him for forgiveness. 1 John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sin, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sin and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” Even the sin of abortion. I do think it takes real faith to believe in that type of forgiveness.\\nAmy Evenson: So what about a woman who says she can’t forgive herself?\\nJulie Ganschow: Well a woman who says she can’t forgive herself will say things like, “I know God has forgiven me, but I can’t forgive myself.” This is ultimately a lack of faith in God. It is as though she is saying to herself and to God, “Your sacrifice was good enough for that sin, but not for this sin.” In doing so she is effectively negating the power of the sacrifice of Christ in her life. There is no biblical support for forgiving yourself. I do understand that there are nagging feelings that go along with having committed a horrible sin of any kind, including abortion. The Lord doesn’t say you are forgiven if you feel forgiven. And the Lord doesn’t say you are forgiven if you forgive yourself. He says, “You are forgiven.” This is something that must be believed and received.\\nWhen you repent and confess your sin of abortion, both 1 John 1:9 and Hebrew 10:17 say that God remembers the sin no more. It is no longer a part of who you are. If a woman is struggling with forgiveness, she has to remind herself that the very reason that Christ died was to pay the penalty for our sin because we are incapable of doing it for ourselves. To believe that we must forgive ourselves is a very grievous sin before God, telling him that Jesus’ sacrifice was not enough for your sin of abortion. It is simply an unbiblical thought life. We must renew our minds consistently with the truth of God’s character, his forgiveness, and by reading the Old Testament narratives about people who were forgiven of horrible grievous sin. And there is probably no man greater in the New Testament than the apostle Paul, who was forgiven of great sin before God because of the great sacrifice of Christ.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbortion\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmy Evenson is the Executive Assistant to Dr. Heath Lambert at\\xa0First Baptist Church\\xa0in\\xa0Jacksonville, Florida.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJulie Ganschow is the founder and Director of Reigning Grace Counseling Center and Biblical Counseling for Women.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Hope After an Abortion', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 13', 'author': 'Heath Lambert  Sandy Lindon', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Abortion 8', 'question': 'We must care for the women in our midst who have chosen abortion, pointing them to the grace of Christ.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert:\\xa0We are continuing this month our focus on the revelations of the practice of abortion and Planned Parenthood and the way that has just riveted the nation. And as the culture focuses on this issue, one thing that is actually easy to overlook is the pain that women experience on the other side of abortion. To help us talk about that today I’ve invited as our special guest Sandy, who is a woman who decades ago made a decision to have an abortion, and I want to talk with her about her experience of that. I’d like her to help the church think through her situation and how to help other women in that situation. Sandy, we’re so glad that you are with us today. And I would like you to tell us the story that led to your decision to have an abortion.\\xa0\\nSandy Lindon:\\xa0I had an abortion nearly 25 years ago, 25 years ago this month actually. I was 18, dating a young man that I loved and would later marry, and we found ourselves pregnant. And I can agree with something we had talked about previously, there’s the fear, the selfishness, the pride, all of those contribute to the fact that yes, this is what I’m going to pursue. And you know, like I said, I was 18. I was an unbeliever at the time, but I still knew that this was a life, that would be ended. And yet I chose to pursue that route of abortion out of fear. This is what my boyfriend at the time thought would be best. There seemed to be no other way out. I didn’t feel like I had anyone that I could turn to, that could help me out of this, that could help me deal with this, that could help me through that pregnancy. If the father of the baby was going to be unable to do that then I felt, there was no one else to help me do that. So, we made that decision together. And you know you are told that this will be okay, you can move on after this, and that day my life was forever changed. There was a life that was lost, that was taken away, at my hands. And my life was forever changed. I have lived my entire adult life living a lie enslaved to shame. Like I said, I didn’t know Christ at the time. I came to know Christ in 1998 and received His forgiveness but had not yet received healing. I have only recently had that healing and that’s through Healing Hearts, what the Lord did through that ministry and my life is unbelievable. I don’t know if there’s a way I can describe what that meant to me.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0You mentioned your need for healing in the aftermath of this. You weren’t a Christian when you had the abortion, and you became a Christian afterward. But even becoming a Christian that didn’t take away the pain immediately that was in your life. Help us understand what some of the tragic falls out were in your life in the aftermath of this abortion.\\xa0\\nSandy Lindon:\\xa0I was sharing earlier that not a day has gone by that I haven’t thought of that day, that day in August. You know what I did, what I was capable of, the fallout continues. Even now, 25 years later, it has affected every single aspect of my life. I can look back at every situation in my life that has caused pain and suffering to myself or someone else and trace it back to that day. The way I relate to my children, there’s part of me that feels guilty. I’m a mom of six kids. The Lord has blessed my husband and myself, but I have found myself even withholding part of myself from them out of guilt. Because, you know, that other child, deserved as much love as these children get. The relationship I have with my husband, you know at 18 I followed his lead. I submitted to that decision and since we were married to view him as priest of my home, protector of my home, and provider for my home, that has been such a challenge. Because I’ve always tried to blame him for that sin. And that’s something that we are still working on and working through.\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0You mentioned that some of the best and most significant help in your life and the aftermath of the abortion actually came about fairly recently. So tell me what the Lord did to really bring about change and help and hope in your life in particular, what were some of the most significant aspects of your counseling that God really used to help?\\nSandy Lindon:\\xa0Well, just getting me to the point of receiving counseling, there was just this chain reaction of events that occurred the week before I started. I had a friend tell me, I don’t know what you’re going through, but you need to share it with somebody because Satan can’t use it against you once it’s brought to light, he can no longer use that against you. My husband’s a student here at Southern and Healing Hearts actually came to one of his classes. Sue shared a part of her testimony and so my husband pointed me to Healing Hearts and that very week I confessed my sin of abortion. I attended the mother-daughter conference at Healing Hearts and that following Monday I started counseling with Healing Hearts. I’ve been looking back through my study from day one to the last day. It is like night and day. I never dreamed that I would find healing even starting the study. As optimistic as I was, yes, this is a good thing I want to do this. It was something that I never imagined possible that God would do in my life.\\nSo, I give credit to God first and foremost for the work that Christ has already done, but in using Healing Hearts it was life-changing. Some of the main points that I took away from the study with Healing Hearts every single day, you are pointed to Christ. You are taken to the Cross every single part of that study you meet Jesus there, and so that’s just phenomenal. Isaiah 53, walking through that and seeing the suffering of Christ and how God did not withhold. He did not keep Christ from that suffering, but ultimately brought healing to us through Christ and that just affected me so much. And how you know, forgiveness, I’ve tried to forgive myself before even after I became a Christian and that doesn’t work. It only comes through Christ because of Christ. I’ve kind of had two views of my heart after the abortion. And one is just sort of a physical image that I have in my mind of my heart and what it was like. And it was literally a bloody mess that was just shattered, and I tried to bandage that and I tried to fix it as best I could. I tried to put those Band-Aids on there. And wound care doesn’t work that way, it will only fester. It may feel better for a little while but when those bandages come off you are still left with that open gaping wound. And only through Christ are you ever going to receive that healing.\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0So much of the focus among Christians right now is on the sort of culture war against Planned Parenthood and a culture of death that we live in. But your story reminds us that we’re not merely talking to a culture. We are talking to people to women, who have been put through a lot of pain, and a lot of difficulty, because of this culture that we live in. And as members of the church, we need to grow up in our ability, to speak the truth in love, to women who are dealing with difficulties in the aftermath of an abortion. And so, what do you think the church needs to know to most effectively minister to women in your situation?\\xa0\\nSandy Lindon:\\xa0Well, I shared earlier that I don’t know how I would have really made it through this news of Planned Parenthood, knowing that I played a role in that, I was part of that, I have had an abortion. The well-meaning people, that have the right view of abortion, it is wrong, it is wicked, it is evil. But there is no love behind that view. I’ve never felt that I could really engage. a conversation with people because, yes, abortion is wrong. It is sin, but people need Christ. People need the gospel. Yes, we want to stop this, but we also need to point people to Christ. I think as a church, you know, for me, 25 years of hiding in and living this lie to have someone that I could go to not necessarily a group setting, not that, that’s a bad thing for me. That would have never been an option for me. I felt isolated anytime, you know, a crisis pregnancy center is mentioned in church. I would have physical symptoms, my heart would race, I would get nauseous, I would be short of breath, just physically ill at the mention of the word abortion. I, until two months ago, was not able to say the word and to have a safe place, to have someone, you know, like you can go to this person in confidentiality and in love and share this with them and bring it out into light so that Satan can’t use it against you.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0Well, I want you to know how glad I am that you’re here with us today talking about this, and I want you to know how thankful I am that. The most important thing about you is not the decision you made 25 years ago, but the love that Jesus Christ had for you two thousand years ago. And we are very grateful that you would come here and talk with us about this.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbortion\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSandy Lindon', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Helping Women Considering an Abortion', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 12', 'author': 'Camille Cates  Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Abortion 8', 'question': 'How can the church come alongside women thinking through an abortion?', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: We are continuing to devote the month of August to the Planned Parenthood crisis that It has really gripped our nation and has forced a fresh conversation among Christians and the wider culture about issues of the sanctity of life. And in the aftermath of the Planned Parenthood Revelations, many Christians have expressed their horror at the reality of abortion. That horror is well-founded because abortion truly is horrible. And yet, it’s one thing to express shock as we address the culture. And it’s another thing to draw near to women who are wrestling with whether or not to have an abortion. We need understanding and so we don’t want to just talk about how to address the culture, we want to talk about how to help women who are struggling with this decision. To help us answer this question, I’ve asked Camille Cate to join us on the podcast today. She’s the Youth Division Director of Healing Hearts, a ministry that helps post-abortive women. And one of the things that I want to ask you Camille is to help us understand some of the reasons that a woman would seek out an abortion.\\xa0\\nCamille Cates: Thank you Heath for having me. I think there’s two kinds of areas or reasons why women would seek an abortion. The first would be more of a situational, you know, it’s what they see kind of in their face. So a woman might seek an abortion because she finds herself pregnant, but she’s not married and she is thinking about single parenting and deciding in her own mind that she cannot do that on her own. A pregnancy she might feel gets in the way of her educational or career goals. So, she would seek an abortion. A couple might be diagnosed with medical problems in a pregnancy and the doctor is encouraging them or pressuring them even to have an abortion. Could be family or partner pressure that they’re not ready or they’re worried about their reputation or their goals and then it would interfere with them. So, there are a lot of situational reasons that a young woman or a woman might find herself, abortion-minded or pursuing an abortion. But then something that we like to address as a ministry is really not just the situation but the heart because there’s a heart behind why we would desire, why any woman would desire or seek out an abortion. And at the root of those things are usually three things in particular. One would be fear. A lot of women are just fearful they’re afraid of partners leaving,\\xa0they’re afraid of losing an educational opportunity, fear of what loved ones are going to say or do. They may be in a bad situation, in a bad relationship. So in their mind an abortion is going to solve or ease that fear. Selfishness I hate to say it, but I’ve heard young women in this day and age I mean, they don’t want to stop their party lifestyle. I heard of a young woman, she was hoping to get a tattoo and that area. So she didn’t want a pregnancy to disrupt that. So as much as that kind of shocks us, selfishness is another root. And then pride and really all of those forms really boiled down to pride. And I’m post-abortive myself and looking back and see and point to some of those things. Fear, selfishness in my own pride at the heart of that. But my situation really clouded that. So it’s helping women get to the heart of why they think that they need an abortion.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0You know, that’s really helpful. And it sounds like when we are doing ministry to women who are considering an abortion, we need to think about a couple of realities. On the one hand, there is the sanctity of life, which we want to fight to preserve. But on the other hand, there are practical realities in a woman’s life that would lead her to undermine the sanctity of life. And we need to be equipped to help her address those realities. So let’s talk about the sanctity of life first. We obviously need to emphasize the importance of life, but how can we talk about that with a woman considering an abortion, in a way that will really mean the most to her?\\xa0\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0You know, I think grace-filled truth from God’s word is the best source, the best go to. You know, most women that are seeking or pursuing an abortion have been lied to or have believed lies. Maybe their own imaginings about what life in the womb is really like, or what they think it’s not. So when they hear things like oh it’s just a blob of tissue, or it’s not really life yet, it’s not life until the heart starts beating, those kind of things. They don’t understand and they will justify and rationalize things that will ultimately, like you said, undermine the importance of life. I think of passages like Psalm 139 that are key, a lot of people use that to talk about life. But I think there’s a right way and a wrong way to help somebody from God’s word, and I think oftentimes we can throw out what I call scripture bombs or grenades that we just think we can lob out there into somebody’s heart and life and think that they’re going to explode and do something great. But God’s word is more like medicine to our hearts. And so if I was talking with somebody or ministering to somebody who was abortion minded, I would go to passages like Psalm 139 and walk through some of those verses. Verses 1 through 12 are really great passages about the sovereignty of God and how he’s our Creator and he knows us intimately. No one else truly on the planet knows what that woman is going through, where she’s at, where she’s been, or even her future like God does. And so to walk her through some of those verses there in Psalm 139 would bring comfort to her, to know that somebody else knows exactly what she’s going through at the time if you go onto verses 13 through 16 talks about how he knits life together in the womb. Those are really powerful passages that really can’t be ignored. And I like to instead of just reading those to somebody, I’ll turn my Bible around and say, “why don’t you read that to me?” And reading God’s word is so powerful when the Holy Spirit is also there to help convict and in speak to life, because he is the author of life. So, taking them through those scriptures, I also talked about how we were created as image-bearers of God. I mean that’s why he is the author of life and the one who determines life is because he’s created, he’s put his mark on people as his image bearer. And so, the woman that you’re ministering to she needs to realize she’s an image-bearer. And you can go back to Genesis or James chapter 3 and show her from those scriptures. But also this new life created in her womb is also an image-bearer and therefore, has the right to life.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0We said we need to emphasize the importance of life. We also talked about how there’s these practical realities that we want to address. The last church that I pastored, we had what we called a blank check policy. And if there was a woman considering an abortion, we were just going to start writing checks. I mean if she needed transportation, we were going to get transportation, if she needed a place to live, we were going to do it. What are practical things that churches can do to minister to those practical concerns that women are having that leads them to have an abortion makes sense to them?\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0Well, I think it’s great. I admire that your church does that. I think it would be great if every Church would budget that and, in their budget make it part of their missions because there’s the physical need. I mean people who are used to only having to clothe the one body, feed one mouth you know now they’ve got to consider how am I going to provide for this other life that I’m now responsible for; and they may not have the means to meet those practical needs. So if the church can come around and support and supply those physical needs that’s great. The spiritual need is also great, obviously sometimes we don’t know where these women are coming from. Some of them may have come out of a domestic violence situation, or a rape, or their loved ones have kicked them out of the home. They need a place to go. They need counseling for their heart. I love what ACBC does in equipping churches and laypeople to counsel from God’s word on any issue. Places like Vision of Hope in Lafayette, Indiana, great place for women to go that need residential care, and they can be helped with their education. That’s important. The statistic is that one out of three young women that find themselves pregnant, only one of them finishes their high school education. So really helping them to continue on and be a life learner is a great goal.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0So we have brothers and sisters all across the world who share a commitment to life and protecting the unborn. And yet, they a talk about that in ways that are really ineffective and really harmful, what are some of the stupid things that well-intended Christians do to try to protect life but undermine their efforts?\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0Some of the things that I have seen that are not very effective to someone who is either abortion-minded or who’s had an abortion, that needs to be ministered to. Social media posts can get a little crazy and very opinionated and sometimes you’re out there and you’re not thinking about the audience at large that you’re speaking to. So you may be thinking that you’re talking to like-minded people who are on some political agenda with you and forgetting that the statistic is one out of three women had an abortion by the time they’re middle age in our country. So you may very well be giving that same message that is hurtful to a post-abortive person or someone who is abortion minded who’s reading it. Billboards, I’ve seen billboards, I’ve seen bumper stickers, that probably well-intended and speaking the truth about life, but not in love and not filled with God’s grace. So I remember seeing a bumper sticker that said, abortion equals murder, any questions. Well yeah, I have some questions. I have a lot of questions, in fact are you just going to drive by with your bumper sticker or do you want to sit down and talk with me, and hear my side, and my story, and what I’m going through, and be willing to help in the in the situation that I’ve found myself in. And so, you know, I think that those are some things that people do that maybe are well-meaning but need to be rethought through.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0Our concerns about abortion aren’t just limited to the unborn baby. We are truly concerned about this woman who is considering an abortion and so how can we as Christians best communicate our care to women who are thinking about this?\\nCamille Cates:\\xa0I think that’s great to think of it as both, we’re ministering to both. You know, Jesus said the second greatest command is to love your neighbor as yourself. You have to realize that you’re dealing with two neighbors. You’re trying to love two people. The woman standing in front of you and the baby that is being carried in their womb. And we can’t forget sometimes their husband or their boyfriend also. So there can be several people that you’re trying to minister to. I think one of the greatest ways that you can communicate care to them and concern for them, is expressing commitment. Are you going to be there to help them through this pregnancy if they choose life? Are you going to be there from beginning to end and be there as a support as a church? Whether that’s finding resources for them at a local pregnancy care center, your church is going to provide clothing, help with rides to doctors’ appointments. Some people don’t have means. So they need support to be able to give care for their pregnancy and beyond. And I think that’s the thing is we got to remember, we’re not just about saving babies were about life and sharing the gospel. We can’t forget that their spiritual needs there as well. And so, we’re ministering to them practically and spiritually. At the same time knowing that, they have our utmost commitment to them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbortion\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCamille Cates is the Assistant Director of Healing Hearts Ministries International.

      "{'title': 'Creating a Culture of Life in the Local Church', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 11', 'author': 'Amy Evenson  Greg Gilbert  Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Abortion 8', 'question': 'How can a church address sanctity of life?', 'body': 'Heath Lambert:\\xa0For the entire month of August, we are focusing on the sanctity of human life as the Planned Parenthood crisis continues to erupt in our nation. And on this edition, we want to talk about how Christians can work together to create a culture of life and the local church. It’s not enough that Christians be in favor of life. We have to be focused on creating a culture of life in\\xa0the local church. And to help us think that through today, I’ve invited as our guest on the program today to be Greg Gilbert. He is the pastor of Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, Kentucky. He’s the author of What is the Gospel?, Who is Jesus?,\\xa0and Why I Trust the Bible? all from Crossway, and he is one of the most effective pastors I know. And I’m so glad he’s with us to help us think about how to be a faithful Church leader. I’ve also asked Amy Evensen on to the podcast today, Amy is the producer of Truth and Love, and she is going to help us think through this issue by directing some questions to Greg and me.\\xa0\\nQuestion: So, the topic of this podcast is creating a culture of life in the local church. With that, I think it would be helpful for our listeners to understand what you mean by that. And maybe aren’t Christians already doing this?\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0Yeah, I think that’s a great question, and you know, I realized that we need to be creating a culture of life and our churches in a surprising way. About 15 years ago, I was a college student, and I was really concerned about protecting the unborn I visited a crisis pregnancy center in the Boston area. And wanted to ask the man who was running it, “what can we do, as Christians in the area, to really help support your work of advancing the cause of life?” And he said, well, you know, one of the most important things you could do is work to encourage life with the Christian women and men that you know. Because so many women that we see seeking out abortions in the Boston area come from churches, and they believe that they cannot carry this pregnancy to term because of the stigma that’s attached to their illegitimate pregnancy in the context of the local church. And that was a shocker to me, and I realized that we just have to be painfully honest as Christians and admit that the need to be issuing a strong call of life is not just something that we do to the culture, but it’s something that we say in our churches as well.\\xa0\\nQuestion:\\xa0So, what are some of the things pastors and local leaders can do to help foster this culture of life in their church?\\xa0\\nGreg Gilbert:\\xa0Yeah, that’s a good question. I think there are a lot of things that leaders can do. I mean, a lot of its structural so it’s not something that you can just flip a switch on and make happen. But for one thing, I think we ought to be very deliberate for this and a lot of other reasons about creating a culture in our churches where Christians and members of our churches can’t be anonymous. There is a value system, even among evangelical Christians right now, that says that their churches ought to allow them to get in and get out very quickly without the necessity of actually knowing anybody. And you’ll run into people who will say that that is the kind of church that they’re looking for. I wish every church in America would just blow that entire expectation up and say, “no, if you’re going to be a member of our church, you need to be somebody who’s known.” And when that happens, when other Christians began to get involved in life, it becomes much harder to live in that shadow land of hypocrisy where you’re able to take such a massive action against Christian conviction without anybody knowing it. So I think that’s huge. I think pressing on the importance of the issue is important to do very publicly. So in your prayers as a pastor, in front of the entire church, in sermon application, in other teaching opportunities, in Sunday school, or whatever else, talk about it. It’s not a pastor’s job to avoid those uncomfortable dinner conversations as we talked about, you know, politics and religion. That’s not what we do. We talk about, as pastors, the uncomfortable stuff, and even if it makes our congregations squirm a little bit in their pews, we have to talk about it as pastors, issues like abortion and make it clear what the Bible says about them.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0I agree with everything that Greg just said, and I would even just add that we need to learn as Christians that we don’t speak about morality without speaking of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Our call as Christians is not merely choosing life. It’s not merely don’t have an abortion; it is repent and believe. We don’t expect unbelievers to act like believers. We call all people to trust in the gospel, which is God’s power.\\xa0\\nQuestion:\\xa0What are some of the problems that foster a context of hypocrisy in the church? Like you said earlier, even Christians are having abortions and hiding it because of the stigma that’s attached with it.\\nGreg Gilbert:\\xa0I think one of the most important things is a sense that if you’re a church person, you need to have it all together. And so, therefore, to admit that something has happened to you due to a choice that you’ve made, you know, that you sinned sexually, and you’ve become pregnant, whether you’re a teenager or young adult or whatever. Even to admit that is to crack the facade of perfection and put togetherness that Christians like to show to each other. So insofar as Christians and church leaders are contributing to that kind of misconception, that Christians have it all together and that we never have any sin to deal with, we never have any consequences from sin; we are contributing to people when they find themselves in those situations simply lying about it and going and doing things in secret, in order to maintain the facade. So, I think that’s huge.\\xa0\\nQuestion:\\xa0We talked about what pastors can do, but what can church people do?\\xa0\\nGreg Gilbert:\\xa0Yeah, well, above all, pray and cry out to God for justice for these unborn babies that are being systematically killed and dismembered for money. Just pray. There’s an amazing picture in the book of Revelation of the Saints holding bowls of incense and their prayers going up before the throne of God. And it’s fascinating because, in the very next paragraph of that image, the thing that moves God to pour out judgment on the world is that he sees the incense of the prayers of the Saints going up. It’s just an incredible picture that what moves the heart of God toward justice and to act in a certain moment is the prayers of the Saints. So prayer, I think is the number one thing. You know, beyond that, one of the things that I was doing that I’ve been most amazed by over the past couple of years is actually seeing the power of social media. It’s incredible, and I think pretty astonishing, just how powerful social media is to force change in even these huge national issues. So get a social media account, get a Twitter account. And start retweeting the things that are said that are useful and pointed and poignant, put pressure on local and state leaders, tweet at them. You know I’ve sent out a couple of tweets that are tagged at Louisville Mayor and just ask him questions about what’s going on. Every time you retweet one of those, somebody on the staff of that state leader or local leader is seeing that and getting a little more scared of the groundswell of discontent among the people. So it’s incredible the power of social media to get inside people’s heads and move politicians and other leaders toward change. So I’d say do that. Don’t think that’s a kind of useless and powerless action that you can take; it’s not. It’s very powerful.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0I think that’s a great thing that Greg said we need as Christians to be speaking to the culture. I would also just say that as pastors and leaders, we need to be people who cultivate in our churches a level of comfort with talking about sin. All of us show up as sinners. And that means sooner or later, leaders are going to have to be people who are honest about their own struggles with sin. That doesn’t mean that the pulpit turns into a confessional or something like that. But it does mean we need to be honest that we are people who struggle with sin, and when we are honest that we struggle with sin, people who listen to us will find the freedom to be able to talk about their own struggles as well. I’d also say that as we speak about issues of abortion and the sanctity of human life, we better be doing it a lot in our churches. But as we do that, we need to be aware that we are speaking about abortion, not just about the culture and what they’re doing. We’re speaking about abortion to people in our churches that have had abortions. We are talking to people in our churches who are quietly considering an abortion. And so, we need to have our speech be gracious and seasoned with salt so that as we speak about life, people sense that we are the kind of person they could come up to and ask for help and not merely the kind of person that’s going to condemn them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbortion\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmy Evenson is the Executive Assistant to Dr. Heath Lambert at\\xa0First Baptist Church\\xa0in\\xa0Jacksonville, Florida.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreg Gilbert is Senior Pastor at Third Avenue Baptist Church in Louisville, KY.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'A Fight For Life', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 9', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Abortion 8', 'question': 'How should Christians respond following the horrors revealed about the operations of Planned Parenthood?', 'body': 'Today we are going to focus on a problem that affects our society as a whole, and that is the problem of abortion. Abortion affects society as well as individuals. We will be addressing how it affects individuals later this month. In fact, we are devoting the entire month of August to a discussion of various facets of the abortion issue. Today we are focusing on the problem of abortion as it impacts our entire culture.\\nI had planned on devoting the next several podcasts to something else, but that was before the Center for Medical Progress began releasing the undercover videos of Planned Parenthood. These videos reveal the abortion work of Planned Parenthood in all of its grisly horror. More than that, it demonstrates leaders in Planned Parenthood engaging in the sale of body parts of tiny, precious children for money. Christians have always been against abortion, but these videos have exposed the work of Planned Parenthood in a way that demands Christians prioritize this issue. In one sense, nothing has changed because Christians have always known that this was going on and have always thought it to be wrong, yet these videos have placed this reality before our national consciousness in a way that has never existed. The videos have made us aware of the trafficking of human beings in a way that was previously unknown. The lights have come on in a darkened room and so many of us have been shocked by what was going on right next to where we’re sitting. As a result, we have a very significant and clear challenge that we have to face as Christians. We are confronted again that we are living in a culture of death, which is abortion.\\nIt is the great moral disaster of our time and the carnage is seen on so many levels. The obvious level is the unborn children that are being ruthlessly murdered and placed up for sale. In the United States of America alone, there are more than 1 million abortions every year. Since 1973, when abortion was legalized in Roe vs. Wade, there have been almost 60 million abortions. This is a holocaust of human lives like nothing that has ever taken place before in the history of planet earth. Every year something like 1/3 of those abortions are committed by Planned Parenthood. And so we see the carnage and the cost of human lives of unborn children.\\nHowever, that’s not the only place we see the carnage of abortion. We also see the human cost in the lives of women who submit to these abortions. Millions of women struggle with the grief of a decision they made to end a human life for their entire life. The pain in the lives of these women is unspeakable and often gets overlooked as we talk about a right to choose. We also need to talk about the carnage in the lives of men who have impregnated women, and then urged them to get an abortion out of convenience. Many men all across the country struggle with the guilt of these decisions and the pressure they applied to the women in their lives and the human beings whose lives were lost because of those decisions.\\nPerhaps least obvious of all, we need to talk about the human carnage to the proponents of abortion. We have to be honest about the difficulty and the pain brought into the lives of those who advocate for abortion. Of course these people don’t know it, but in advocating for such a vile practice they are destroying their very souls. In the language of Romans 2:5, they are storing up wrath for themselves on the day of wrath when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.\\nConsider some of the comments by abortion advocates as we consider the judgment they store up for themselves. Last year, Cecile Richards, the leader of Planned Parenthood was asked by a reporter when life begins and she said, “it’s not something that I feel like is really part of this conversation. I think every women needs to make her own decision.” The reporter followed up asking, “why is it controversial to say when life starts?” Cecile Richards responded, “I don’t know that it is controversial. I don’t know that it’s really relevant to the conversation. I’m the mother of three children. For me, life began when I delivered them.” She added that her children have “probably been the most important thing in my life ever since, but that was my own personal decision.” Hillary Clinton, a candidate for the President of the United States, characterized a vote pending in the United States Congress to block funding from Planned Parenthood like this, “it’s another effort by the Republicans to limit the health care options of women.”\\nHere we have women who are mothers and leaders saying that life is about a women’s personal decision, it’s about her healthcare, or it’s about playing politics. As heartbreaking as these statements are, as Christians we actually understand what drives someone to make them. We are given the reason in Ephesians 4:17-18. Paul says,\\n‘Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds. They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart.’\\nPeople are ignorant and futile in their minds because their hearts are hard and that leads them into darkness. That is to say that what drives statements like the ones we read from abortion proponents, Cecil Richards and Hilary Clinton, is sinful insanity. That’s what Paul says in Ephesians 4: their minds are darkened, they are futile, and their hardened hearts make them that way. It takes sinful insanity to articulate this kind of defense of human self-destruction. It is only the maddening folly of sin that would lead some people to attack other people whose only offense is being as young and defenseless as we all once were. It is the lunacy of sin that would lead us to bring war and carnage to the place where every loving mother knows her child should be the most safe. It is the craziness of a hard and sinful heart that would believe the nearer a child is to a mother’s beating heart, the greater is her right to stop that child’s heart from beating. It takes hard-hearted sinful insanity to justify all of that under the wicked misnomer of women’s health. And so we know what’s going on here. It is an all out war of the kingdom of darkness against the kingdom of light and we must act. Christians all across the country, indeed all across the world are asking, ‘what must we do?’ I want to give a few suggestions:\\nFirst, you need to call your representative in Congress. You can call the capital switchboard at (202) 224-3121 and ask to speak to your Senator or Congressmen and plead with them to vote in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood. There is a bill pending in the United States Congress even now – some suggest that it could be voted on as early as today, Monday (August 3, 2015) – that would restrict the funding of the United States government to go to Planned Parenthood; which last year was over $500 million. Many are predicting that the vote can’t pass, but the Lord knows about it and the Lord can help. I want to give the names of several Senators that are being reported by the Ethics and Religious Liberties Commission as potential swing votes to turn the tide in favor of passage of this law. If you are a resident of Illinois, you need to call republican Senator, Mark Kirk today and ask him to support defunding Planned Parenthood. If you are a resident of Maine, you need to call republican Senator Susan Collins. If you are a resident of Alaska, you need to call republican Senator Lisa Murkowski. If you live in West Virginia, call Joe Manchin today. If you are a resident of Indiana, Joe Donnelly is one of your senators and you need to call today and appeal to him to support this effort. If you live in Pennsylvania, Bob Casey needs to hear from you today that you want him to defund Planned Parenthood.\\nSo, you can call your senators and congressmen, another thing you can do is use social media. Tweet, go on Facebook, use instagram, use pinterest, if you have a blog then write a blog, if you use twitter use the hashtags #defundpp or #anotherboy or other popular hashtags. It sounds like a silly suggestion, but use social media. If it weren’t for social media, we wouldn’t have known about this crisis. It was Christians, people who are committed to saving unborn lives who put this information out to the public almost exclusively using social media. So don’t think that that’s an ineffective means.\\nThe next thing that you can do is preach the Gospel. Don’t just call your representatives, or post a tweet, but preach the Gospel when you do those things. Romans 1:16 says, “the Gospel…is the power of God for salvation to everyone believes…” There must be no confusion that our commitment to life is inextricably linked to our commitment to Jesus Christ. We want to speak of Him into a culture of such desperate need of change because we have experienced His change, bringing us out of death and into life. The Gospel of Jesus Christ teaches that all people, including unborn babies, are precious and the Gospel of Jesus Christ also teaches that all people, even abortionists, can change. The call to end abortion is an opportunity to speak the light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ into a world darkened and hardened by sin. Our call is to use this horrifying sin as the opportunity to call an entire culture to repentance. We want this because we were all once just as lost as any of the guilty people exposed in the Planned Parenthood videos. And so, our call as Christians is not merely to defund Planned Parenthood. Our call is to repent, to turn to Jesus Christ and then overflow with His love by taking away the funding of people bent on human destruction.\\nThese are massive realities, huge things that we are called to today. They are things that are too big for us, and so the last things that I want to encourage you to do is fast and pray. All of us at the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors are going to be spending today, August 3, 2015, fasting and praying for the saving of human lives, for the defunding of Planned Parenthood, and for the light of the Gospel to be spread to a culture encased in darkness. I want to ask that you would join us. If you can’t join us today, then join us some other day even if Planned Parenthood is defunded this week or next. There will be many battles yet to fight in a country where abortion remains legal, and so we all need to appear before the Throne of Grace together and beg our God to do what only He can do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbortion\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Sword Words', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Keith Palmer', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Abuse 28', 'question': 'Sword words, or verbal abuse, hurt, do damage, and feel like the thrusts of a metal object into your body.', 'body': \"Let me tell you about the Smith family. You probably have met a family like the Smiths before, or if not, you will certainly meet them at some point in your counseling ministry. They come to your church, a husband and wife that are wonderful people. They’ve got a boy and a girl in their family, and they have been a part of your church for many years. Dad is optimistic, he’s a bit of a people pleaser and kind of avoids conflict, but he’s a never-met-a-stranger kind of guy. Mom is personable, friendly, talented, but superficial in her relationships with others. Their kids are great. They’re involved in your church. And as far as you know, this is the American family.\\nTruth be told, as God providentially works so often in these cases, you as a biblical counselor or as a pastor or as just a brother or sister in Christ in your church, get to know more about a family like this. As you get to know more about a family like this, you are utterly shocked in what you find out.\\nAs the story unfolds in this particular family, there is turmoil in the home. What is presented on Sunday morning when everybody looks nice and sounds nice is not the normal atmosphere at home. In fact, it is horribly worse than even you could possibly imagine. What this mother says to her children and to her husband is horrible.\\nLet me give you some examples:\\n“I hate you.”“Why can’t you be more like your sister?”“I despise you.”“I wish you were never my daughter.”“You’re stupid.”“You will never be good at anything.”\\nAnd that’s not an occasional occurrence—this is the normal script in the Smith home. As you get to know the family, as others in your church get to know the family, you recognize that this is not a good situation. This is a crisis situation. As more information is gathered, as you get to know them more, as your pastors intervene, as you as a biblical counselor may be getting involved, you uncover years of a pattern of hateful, angry, hurtful, calculated, controlling, perverse speech toward a spouse and toward children. And you didn’t know about it because everything looked good on Sunday. If you haven’t met a family like that yet, you will. The reality is in a broken world of sinful people, even many of whom attend our churches, this tragically goes on far more than we would want to admit.\\n“Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words may never hurt me,” is a satanic lie from the depths of hell. How do we know that? We know because the Scriptures tell us.\\nListen to the Proverbs. Proverbs 12:18, “There is one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword, but the tongue of the wise brings healing.”\\nProverbs 11:9, “With his mouth the godless man destroys his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous will be delivered.”\\nProverbs 18:21, “Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit.”\\nProverbs 15:4, “A soothing tongue is a tree of life, but perversion in it crushes the spirit.”\\nProverbs 16:27, “A worthless man digs up evil, while his words are like scorching fire.”\\nThat’s why I titled this workshop Sword Words—because there’s one who speaks rashly like the thrusts of a sword. If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of sword words, you know that they do hurt, and in some cases they hurt more than even being hurt physically. The Bible has a category for this. It is words that hurt, words that do damage, words that feel like the thrusts of a metal object into your body.\\nWe might define it, thinking about a biblical way of understanding this, as chronic sinful speech that hurts, demeans, and tears down others. Click To Tweet\\nWhat is Verbal Abuse?\\nWhat is verbal abuse? That’s not a biblical term, although the Bible does use the word “abuse” in some translations. We’re really thinking about a pattern of sinful speech. We might define it, thinking about a biblical way of understanding this, as chronic sinful speech that hurts, demeans, and tears down others. Now there’s a sense in which all forms of sinful speech are hurtful, demeaning, and destructive to others.\\nSinful speech may take the form of tearing down as Ephesians 4:29 says, “Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth.” A foul word, a rotting word, one that would do damage. Earlier in the chapter, Ephesians 4 tells us about lying and deceit, where the Bible would tell us to lay aside falsehood. Being lied to and being deceived are certainly a hurtful form of speech. Angry, bitter words are mentioned in Scripture. Ephesians 4:31 says, “Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.” Paul pulls out his Greek thesaurus. He looks up anger and he writes down all the synonyms to make the point clear that we ought to reject all forms of angry speech.\\nThe Proverbs warn us in Proverbs 11:13 about the talebearer who reveals secrets. Gossip and slander would be also forms of sinful speech.\\nManipulation is another form of sinful speech. You remember the story of Mary and Martha. Martha is preparing things for the Lord, Mary is at the Lord’s feet listening to His word. Martha comes in and what did she say? “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the preparations?” Well, what’s that? It’s manipulation. She’s making an emotional appeal to manipulate the second person of the Trinity.\\nThere are many ways that broken people, sinful people in a fallen world can fall into sinful speech. That’s something that we all need to be working on in progressive sanctification. When we think about verbal abuse, at least as how I’m defining it here from a biblical standpoint, we’re thinking about sinful speech that is especially manipulative—chronically manipulative, driven by a desire to control others. What we might call in a biblical lens self sovereignty that says, “My kingdom come, my will be done.” Whereas we ought to be saying that about the Lord and His kingdom and His authority over our lives.\\nWe think of verbal abuse as bullying, where threatening language is used, angry speech and particularly a hateful form of anger. It’s often characterized by blame-shifting—never taking responsibility. Repentance is rare. It may include name-calling and mockery, as in the case that I told you with the Smith family.\\nI wish I could tell you that the Smith family example is\\xa0a composite of counseling cases—that it’s not really the Smith family. But like you, I’ve sat in the counseling room, I’ve sat with families where I have seen—inches away—a hateful, spiteful, bitter speech on the part of a person to the people he or she is supposed to love and be committed to.\\nSlander and criticism is a part of this. It’s often dismissed as a joke or sarcasm. They may say, “I was just kidding. I was just joking,” but it has it has a dagger in it. It’s reflective often of deep bitterness and resentment. As biblical counselors, we understand that doesn’t just happen. That chronic, sinful speech is the result of sin that has not been handled in a biblical way. It’s a result of doing the same sinful thing over and over and over, so that bitterness and resentment and hate begins to build up in the heart. Apart from the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that becomes the norm. It’s chronic and ongoing.\\nPeople who are subject to this sort of speech over time tend to fall into some patterns. If you’ve worked with people who have been in environments like this or in relationships like this, you know these. The victim of sinful speech, of verbal abuse, they begin to question their own judgment. They begin to blame themselves for the problem. They begin to minimize the situation. They don’t understand or realize the severity of the problem because for many of them it’s normal life.\\nOne of the most shocking things about a case I was involved in is as you’re trying to hold up for a family, “This is biblical normality. This is God’s view of the family. This is how a husband and a wife ought to relate. This is how parents ought to relate to their children. This is what speech should look like in a godly home.” They look at you in disbelief because their experience is so contrary.\\nYet, we don't lose hope because we know the gospel has answers. Click To Tweet\\nVictims of verbal abuse may often develop unhelpful and sinful responses. As they try to deal with this, often they become discouraged, depressed, despairing. We see victims of abuse involved in all sorts of ungodly behavior as they try to find some way to wrestle with, to deal with the severity of being sinned against.\\nYet, we don’t lose hope because we know the gospel has answers.\\nWhat Does the Bible Say About Verbal Abuse?\\nHow does the Bible approach verbal abuse? One of things that biblical counselors always want to do, especially when we see a phenomenon in the counseling world is ask, “How do we understand this biblically?” How do we go to the text? What terms are used? What concepts are used? How does the Bible approach this?\\nPeople who are the victims of abuse of all sorts need to hear these truths that may be obvious to you and me, but may not be so obvious to them. First of all, we need to be very clear that sinful speech is wicked, evil, and wrong.\\nProverbs 6:16-19 says,\\n“There are six things which the Lord hates,Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him:Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,And hands that shed innocent blood,A heart that devises wicked plans,Feet that run rapidly to evil,A false witness who utters lies,And one who spreads strife among brothers.”\\nNotice with me that three of the seven are verbal sins, and you could attribute almost all of them to all forms of abuse, and particularly to verbal abuse. What does the Bible say? It says God hates those things. Victims need to hear that God hates what has been done to them.\\nProverbs 26:28 says, “A lying tongue hates those it crushes.” It is an illustration, an example of hatred when we see this form of speech being communicated. What does God think about such speech? What does He think about such verbal abuse? Proverbs 10:31 says, “The mouth of the righteous flows with wisdom, but the perverted tongue will be cut out.” That’s what God thinks about it. It is horrid. It is wicked. It is an evil. It hurts and God hates it, as He hates all sin.\\nIn Matthew 5, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus equates sinful speech to verbal murder and renders one guilty before God. Starting in verse 21, He says, “You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘You shall not commit murder’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.”\\nIt makes one guilty before God. Like all sin, sinful speech is never justified. In fact, James tells us you can keep the whole law, but break one aspect of it and you become guilty of all. It is never, ever justified.\\nWhat is the future of those who would engage in a sinful form of speech? Well, Jesus tells us in Matthew 12:36, “But I tell you that every careless word that people speak, they shall give an accounting for it in the day of judgment.”\\xa0 Now, let’s remember, brothers and sisters, this is not just abusers. This is all of us. And let us remind ourselves that were it not for the grace of God in our own life, were it not for God’s rescue, we all stand guilty. We all need grace. We all need the gospel.\\nSometimes biblical counselors, and Christians in general, come to something like verbal abuse—or emotional abuse or some other form of abuse—and we’re comfortable with addressing physical abuse. We think, “You’re hurting the person—okay, I know how to deal with that.” Sometimes biblical counselors and Christians, we ask, “What do we do with all these other forms of abuse?” I have to confess that even in preparation for this talk, I was eager to dig into the Scriptures more to understand, “How do we how do we understand this? How do we approach this from a biblical standpoint?”\\nThe Bible really gives us two categories of hurt—and that’s a good biblical word. Hurt is not an unbiblical word, that’s a good word. There’s physical hurt, where we could go to texts that would demonstrate physical pain, physical violence. We understand that is wrong and sinful. I was amazed in preparation for this at how often the Bible actually points us to what we might call a “spiritual hurt.” Sometimes we might call it emotional pain. I think spiritual hurt is a more biblical way of thinking about it, but that’s just me.\\nHere’s what the Bible teaches—this is an internal, inner man, sort of anguish, distress, or pain. It’s immaterial. It’s not done to your physical body as in the case of physical abuse. It’s done to the spiritual part of you—your inner man, your soul, your spirit, your heart. Those are all biblical terms to describe the immaterial part of us.\\nI wanted to give you several verses and several terms because biblical counselors use biblical terminology, right? We want to put them in a biblical framework. We want to come to biblical counseling using the terms and concepts that we find in our Bibles. Here’s some biblical descriptions of what we’re thinking about in terms of spiritual hurt:\\nA broken spirit. In fact, Job says in Job 17, after he’s lost his family, he’s lost his livelihood, and now he has this physical affliction. He says, “I have a broken spirit. And I’m ready for the grave.” He’s saying, “I’m done. I’m done physically. I’m done spiritually. Lord, I’m ready to die.” We also see in Proverbs 15:13, “when the heart is sad, the spirit is broken.”\\nOr Isaiah 65:14 talks about wailing with a broken spirit. That’s an expression of spiritual pain. Or a crushed spirit as we see in Psalm 34:18. A sad heart in those passages. Pain of heart is also described in Isaiah 65. A broken heart or being brokenhearted is described in Psalm 34, Psalm 69, and Psalm 147. These are good biblical terms that give direction for describing this thing called verbal abuse or other forms of abuse that are not physical.\\nThe Bible has real, legitimate categories and as biblical counselors we need to recognize those categories and point our people to see what God says about such things. Click To Tweet\\nThe Bible has real, legitimate categories and as biblical counselors we need to recognize those categories and point our people to see what God says about such things.\\nIn 2 Corinthians, Paul has been verbally abused. Let’s just say it. He was involved in the church at Corinth. He loved this church and between 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians there was something called the “sorrowful letter” that Paul wrote to them because false teachers had come into the church. They were trying to dislodge the biblical foundations and the theological pillars of that church. The way that those false teachers did that was by attacking the Apostle Paul.\\nAnd Paul writes to describe what that feels like. In 2 Corinthians 2:4 Paul writes, “For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears.” Paul’s describing that inner man hurt, that spiritual hurt.\\nI wanted to give some of the Hebrew and Greek words as well so that you could see those definitions.\\nShabar – “break, smash, shatter” used both literally and figuratively (“broken heart”)\\n‘atsebet – “pain” used of both physical pain and emotional sorrow (“sad heart”)\\nLupe – “grieve, sorrow, affliction” used of “pain of mind or spirit”\\nLupeo – “to cause severe emotional or mental distress” or to “experience sadness, grief, distress, or sorrow”\\nPaul writes in 2 Corinthians 2:5 that “Lupeo” pain can be inflicted on another person. At the same time persons can be injured by that as well, to experience sadness, sorrow, or distress. Paul writes in Romans 14:15 that your brother is hurt by carelessness and recklessness in our words and our actions.\\nThe Bible is very clear that some of the most painful human experiences come from spiritual hurt. Sinful speech that is characteristic of verbal abuse is one of the main ways that this kind of pain can be caused.\\nSo, how do we think about this? We think of those who are impacted by verbal abuse—by chronic, sinful speech—as true sufferers, don’t we? You can take any biblical counseling issue—anything you see in ministering to somebody—and put it into buckets. You can put in the bucket of sin or the bucket of suffering. You need to know that because both of those buckets allow you to get to the gospel. Why did Jesus come? To solve the problem of sin so that we could be reconciled to God, and to address the problem of suffering as the man who would bring reconciliation and who is very much the Man of Sorrows, who we come to in our day of grief, who gives us mercy and grace to help. There is authentic suffering in this situation.\\nLet me just talk briefly about terms and language. I’m not trying to get technical here. When we hear language that comes from a psychotherapeutic culture or from a secular counseling system, biblical counselors always want to stop and say, “Okay, how should we think about these? Should we use these terms? Should we not use these terms? Are they helpful or they not helpful?” I’m not advocating that you should use abuse language or you should not use abuse language. I think there are there are strengths and weaknesses to each of those. But let me just give you some principles to remind you.\\nBiblical counselors strive to use biblical terminology as often as possible. Why do we do that? We do that because biblical vocabulary is usually less influenced by a secular, worldly counseling system and thus it is less prone to unbiblical viewpoints, interpretations, theories, and assumptions. Remember terminology is never neutral. With terminology, there are always presuppositions and concepts. There’s always the “what you do about it.” You use a term and if you’re not careful, that term is loaded with significance. Be careful with the terms you use. If you’re going to use abuse language, define those things biblically. Define them conceptually.\\nAlso, biblical vocabulary connects life problems with actual biblical solutions. For example, if you’re dealing with an adultery situation in counseling and you use the word affair, there’s nothing really wrong with that in the sense that everybody knows what you mean. But here’s the problem: You’re telling them the answers are in the Scriptures. They look in their concordance and they go, “I can’t find that term.” One way that we can help people to make connections to the resources that are in the Word of God for help is to use biblical terminology as often as possible. Sometimes it’s not possible, but if we can, we try to do that.\\nThe second thing is that biblical counselors try to use biblical phrases in this situation (like a broken spirit, pain of heart, spiritual hurt) that reflect biblical anthropology. Have you noticed that our friends in the secular counseling world do not buy into biblical anthropology? They do not believe in a biblical doctrine of people. That means their terms, their concepts, their methods, their theories, and their interventions are shaped by an unbiblical anthropology. They often make unbiblical conclusions because they have an unbiblical anthropology. Be careful. We want to be real particular about the terms we use in counseling.\\nI think terms like emotional pain and hurt feelings aren’t bad because people kind of know what you mean, but if you can avoid those and try to use better terms, I think that’s the wiser course. With words like abuse (which is in some translations of the Scriptures) if we’re going to use that term, let’s clearly define it, explain it using biblical concepts, and try to avoid assumptions and implications from a secular counseling view. I really think it’s a wisdom call, but let’s be careful with terminology.\\nGod is Near to the Brokenhearted\\nWith that in mind, how does the Bible help people who have been impacted by the horror of verbal abuse? Let me share with you the main way that the Bible offers help in such situations.\\nLook at Psalm 34. This is the inspired, inerrant, authoritative, sufficient Word of the living God—and this is what so many abuse victims need to hear. Psalm 34:18 says, “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted.” If you’ve done ministry with brokenhearted people, you know that’s not something you tell them in Session 1. That’s something you tell them in Session 1 and Session 2 and Session 3. You saturate your ministry to them with who God is and what He thinks about you in your affliction.\\nWe know God is omnipresent, right? He’s everywhere all the time. We know He especially indwells believers through the Holy Spirit and through our union with Christ, but then the Bible says stuff like this. God has a proximity to the brokenhearted. He’s near. He relates to them. He is focused on them.\\nVerse 18 says, “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.” We need to tell abuse victims that God is near to them, that He loves them, that He desires to save them and help them, that He is close.\\nAbuse makes you feel isolated, doesn’t it? “If I can’t trust my spouse, who can I trust?”\\nThey need to hear God is near to the brokenhearted. They also need to hear that God is able to spiritually heal the brokenhearted. Click To Tweet\\nThey need to hear God is near to the brokenhearted. They also need to hear that God is able to spiritually heal the brokenhearted. Psalm 147 speaks to this as well. Now, be careful because when the Bible talks about healing and brokenheartedness, a culture that is highly psychologized hears all sorts of psychological wellness and healing. That’s not what the Scripture is saying.\\nGod is saying that He will heal you spiritually. First in salvation, drawing you to Christ, making you His own, adopting you into His family, forgiving you, encouraging you. Then He will heal you progressively through what we call progressive sanctification, where you grow day-by-day into the image of Christ. God is able to do that.\\nPsalm 147:3 says, “He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” We ask, “How can He do that?” Look at the next verse, “He counts the number of the stars; He gives names to all of them.” The same God who created the heavens and the earth, the same God who put all the stars in their place and names them—that same God is near to you in your affliction. He is especially close and He desires to save you and heal you. What encouragement for hopeless people that think,” there’s no hope for me.”\\nGod’s healing comes through the person and work of the Lord Jesus. Isaiah 61, which foreshadows the coming of the Messiah, the coming of Jesus himself, records these words,\\n“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,Because the Lord has anointed meTo bring good news to the afflicted;He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,To proclaim liberty to captivesAnd freedom to prisoners;To proclaim the favorable year of the LordAnd the day of vengeance of our God;To comfort all who mourn,To grant those who mourn in Zion,Giving them a garland instead of ashes,The oil of gladness instead of mourning,The mantle of praise instead of a spirit of fainting.”\\nWhat we love to do in counseling, what we love to do in ministry to people that are hurting, is to point them to the One who comes to bring good news, to heal the brokenhearted, to bring gladness and joy where these dear people have known in many cases nothing but pain, affliction, and sorrow. That is our role. That is the church’s role. That is the duty and privilege of every Christian. It doesn’t have to be ACBC biblical counselors. We love that, but that is the duty of all who would call upon the name of the Lord. If anyone has a charge, a duty, a role to play in going out into this world of brokenness and people of sorrow and pain, it is us. Brothers and sisters, God has entrusted the gospel of this Jesus to us. It’s our role and our privilege to minister to hurting people.\\nJesus and Verbal Abuse\\nNot only that—God did something even more shocking to address the problem of sin and the problem of suffering. The second person of the Trinity, Jesus Himself, fully God, came to earth and took on humanity. He’s all God and all man. Like I tell my kids, He’s 100 percent God and 100 percent man at the same time in the same person. That’s the incarnation.\\nWhy did Jesus come? He came to experience the suffering, the pain, the affliction that is the normal course of a broken humanity. Isaiah 53 describes Jesus as the man of sorrows who was acquainted with grief. First Peter 2:23 says that, “When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.” Jesus comes to experience these afflictions, to be that sympathetic high priest.\\nWhen a victim of abuse comes to Him saying, “Lord Jesus, I need your help. I need you to intervene. I need you to understand. I need you to listen to me.” You know what Jesus says? “I know what that’s like. I know what it’s like to be verbally abused. I know what it’s like to be physically abused. I know what it’s like to be falsely accused.” Because He was the man of sorrows. Jesus was reviled and He suffered greatly. Jesus also sympathizes with us in our weaknesses. I alluded to that a moment ago with Hebrews 4:15. We’ll come back to that in a few minutes, but you know that text: He’s our sympathetic high priest. He’s been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.\\nHere’s what all abuse victims need to hear: “You can go to the Man of Sorrows and He will relate to you. He will sympathize with you. He understands your situation, both in His omniscience as the Son of God and experientially as the God-man who was afflicted and suffered and abused.”\\nThe Bible tells us in Hebrews 4:16 that we can come to Him—to His throne of grace—to receive mercy and grace to help in time of need. Jesus has sufficient mercy and grace to offer people that are hurting.\\nHe's the man of sorrows. He knows what it's like and He is able to give mercy and grace to help in time of need. Click To Tweet\\nAnd if that wasn’t enough, if we look at Matthew 27, Mark 15, and Luke 23 (all three of the synoptic gospels), we see that Jesus, while He was on the cross bystanders came by and hurled abuse at Him. That’s verbal abuse of the Son of God. Even the criminal next to Him, the text tells us, hurled abuse as well. He’s the man of sorrows. He knows what it’s like and He is able to give mercy and grace to help in time of need.\\nResources for Protection\\nAnytime we talk about an abuse situation, we have to talk about resources for protection. God has ordained two institutions that are His means of grace to help people in abuse situations. We can only wave our hands at them a bit in the time that we have, but let me just remind you of them. First of all, we have the institution of civil authorities.\\nThis is Romans 13, that the government is ordained by God to protect those who do good and to punish those who do bad. The Bible tells us that the civil authorities have a God-ordained authority to punish evildoers. We should be thankful that we live in a country where civil authorities are largely in place to help people that are being abused and sinned against in these sort of ways. As biblical counselors, and just as biblical Christians, we honor those civil authorities insofar as they stand for righteousness. If your state requires certain abuse situation to be reported, we do that as Christians because we honor the government. That’s what we’re called to do in Romans 13. Frankly, the state has authority to protect and intervene in ways that the church and Christians do not. We praise God for that. We use those institutions wisely and we’re thankful that we have them.\\nThe second institution that God has ordained for the protection of people in situations like this is the local church. These are godly pastors and elders, godly friends. The Bible would tell us that in a text like 1 Peter 5 that the elders are to “shepherd the flock of God among you.” They have a care for the flock, which certainly means that they protect those who are in dangerous situations. That text tells us that they are to be like the great Shepherd. We think of Matthew 18:15-17, the passage that we typically think of in church discipline. Church discipline is ordained by Jesus to Christians in the context of local churches to help protect the weak and those who are being sinned against. That is a resource for protection that churches ought to use in biblical wisdom.\\nPsalm 82:4 tells us that those who are being afflicted ought to be rescued. That is the heart of God, to rescue those who are afflicted. Any person who would name the name of Jesus ought to see somebody in danger, see somebody afflicted, and say, “How can I help to get that person out of that situation?” We use the civil authorities and we use the local church as God’s means of grace and those situations.\\nCounsel for the One Sinned Against\\nNow the one sinned against must be very careful. This is where, as biblical Christians, we need to be very careful. The one who is being sinned against, the one receiving the verbal abuse, is never responsible for the abuse itself. The rightful shame is on the person doing the abuse, not the one being abused. We need to tell people that, we need to remind them of that. With the abuse victims I’ve had the privilege of working with, that’s not one thing you say one time. That is an atmosphere of encouragement you build. They need to hear that over and over again. We understand the mind is renewed over and over again progressively (Romans 12:1-2). We need to remind them of the truth of God’s Word.\\nWe also understand that God holds people responsible. God holds all people responsible for how they respond when sinned against. This is where as biblical Christians, we have to be very careful. When we are working with an abuse victim and we see what has been done to them, we want to say over and over again, “My dear brother, my dear sister, you are not responsible for that abuse.”\\nBut at the same time in wisdom, encouragement, care, and compassion we want to come alongside and help that dear brother or help that dear sister to see that God does hold them responsible for how they respond to that abuse. That is where the gospel has such a powerful role to play in helping them to see that God helps them both in the ways that they have been sinned against, but God in the gospel also helps them to know how they can respond in godly and helpful ways.\\nAs biblical counselors, we need to say both of those truths in compassion, care, and wisdom. The person who has been abused needs to be very careful. There are so many off-ramps that a person can take into unhelpful, ungodly, and hurtful things when they’ve been abused.\\nShe must be careful to not deny what is actually happening. You’ve heard this before: “It’s not really that bad. It’s not abuse.” They need to be careful to recognize to not engage in unhelpful responses—things like trying to be good enough to avoid abuse. Thoughts like this: “If I was a better wife, he wouldn’t treat me like that.” Or defending the offender: “He was just having a bad day. He’s stressed because of work.” Or minimizing the situation: “Well, all couples fight, right?”\\nOr falling into what we might call the “victimization trap.” It involves demonizing the abuser, thinking, “My husband is an abuser. He will always be an abuser.” That is a gospel-less statement, isn’t it? And it’s not true.\\nAnother victimization trap that we see is when people only going to focus on the sins of the abuser and ignore the legitimate ways that she may be sinning or doing unhelpful things. Not at all saying that she is responsible for what is done to her, but saying that she does before God need to acknowledge anything that she might be doing that would fall short of the glory of God, where she needs God’s grace and God’s help.\\nHere’s another facet of this victimization trap: Assertiveness doctrine. The world’s answer is, “You need to assert yourself. You need to respond to attempts to control with stronger control.” Again, brothers and sisters, that is gospel-less, that is Jesus-less. Ultimately that’s hopeless because that’s not going to ultimately help her to better the situation.\\nTurning to self instead of turning to Jesus. Abuse is going on and they pull in, and they try to be strong on their own and strong inside. They turn to self and self-trust instead of turning to trust in Jesus. The path to healing is not to trust self more, but to trust Jesus more. So much of the secular message to people of abuse is, “You have to do it. You have to protect yourself.”\\nOr justifying foolish decisions and ungodly behavior because, “I’m an abuse victim.” In our culture, brothers and sisters, that abuse is seen as a blank check or a trump card to justify many foolish decisions and ungodly choices. In compassion, wisdom, care, and encouragement, we need to put our arm around those dear people who have been hurt horribly and say, “My dear friend, I love you, but that is not a course that honors God. That is not going to help you. That is not going to help your situation.” We need to be able to help them to see that.\\nThey may be influenced by worldly and ungodly counsel. Sometimes the thing that is the worst for helping in a counseling situation like this is a well-meaning family member or friend. They’re offering competing counsel to the Word of God, so we need to be careful about that.\\nWe need to help victims of abuse see that turning away from God will make your situation worse. Only turning to God and trusting Him and His Son will help. Click To Tweet\\nThey may respond in self-pity, anger, bitterness, responding in anger toward God. These are all biblical examples of ways that people who have been sinned against horribly turn away from God. Don’t you love how the Psalms do that? They say, “The Lord is my refuge and strength.” I run to Him as the strong tower. There’s all these other things that are false refuges, they are false towers. We turn to those other things instead of to the Lord for help. We need to help victims of abuse see that turning away from God will make your situation worse. Only turning to God and trusting Him and His Son will help.\\nContemporary victimization theology and teaching can be one of those false refuges. We need to be very careful when we see things like this promoting an unbiblical identity (“You’re only an abuse victim”), promoting an unbiblical view of appropriate action, promoting an unbiblical view of the offender (“He’s hopeless; he’ll never change”), promoting an unbiblical view of help, and promoting an unbiblical view of responsibility. That’s the idea that I can justify any decision that I want to do—foolish or otherwise—because of my situation. We need to be careful of that.\\nCounseling Procedure\\nNow with that in mind, I want to turn and talk to you about counseling procedure. How do we help care for people that have been impacted by abuse? In the remaining time I want to speak with you about the procedure.\\nThere are three main ways that I would encourage you that we need to offer care in an abuse situation, and here we’re thinking about verbal abuse. There are three main realms of care. We want to help her deal with her own heart and hurt. We want to help her to deal with the offender. And we also want to help her to deal with the broader situation. As I think about this as a biblical counselor, those are the three main areas of care that we want to think through.\\nOf course as biblical counselors, we’re going to start first of all with thorough data gathering. In an abuse situation, what do we want to think about? The nature of abuse (examples, frequencies, current situation, who’s involved). I would encourage you greatly, because victims of abuse so often do not see the situation clearly, if you are able with appropriate consent from your counselee—we’re not going behind people’s backs—try to talk to other family members, other friends, who may have more insight into the situation than you do as the biblical counselor. Try to do that if possible.\\nTry to find out how is she responding? Where are the particular areas of struggle?\\nWith that in mind, let’s talk about what some of the initial needs are. The first thing we want to think about in virtually every situation of abuse is safety.\\nProverbs 22:3 says, “The prudent sees danger and hides himself,\\xa0but the simple go on and suffer for it.” It is not ungodly to flee danger. It’s a mark of prudence according to Proverbs. It’s a mark of wisdom. When we see a dear brother and sister in danger, our heart ought to be to help get that person out of that dangerous situation.\\nJust in the last month, I had a phone call with a person I’ve known for years and years. The marriage hasn’t been great, but she called me and she said, “My husband was so angry. I don’t know what it was—something in his eyes or something I’ve never seen, and for the first time in my marriage I didn’t feel safe.”\\nYou know what I told her to do? I said, “Pack a bag and go stay with your son until we can size up the situation.” I don’t know the whole story. The first to plead his case seems right, the Proverb says. I don’t know, but if she’s saying “I don’t feel safe,” I want to help get her out of that situation until I can figure out what’s going on. Maybe it’s legitimate, maybe it’s illegitimate, but at that point you err on the side of caution. I think that’s biblical wisdom. I think that is what the Proverbs are saying.\\nI want to read to you from ACBC’s Standards of Conduct.\\n“Biblical counselors must care for counselees in protecting the weak from harm. Counselees can be harmed by others and can inflict harm on themselves. Biblical counselors avoid sinful language and behavior that brings harm into the lives of their counselees. Biblical counselors understand that it is impossible to protect the weak from every danger in a fallen world and yet they endeavor to protect counselees from exposure to the harmful treatment of others through false teaching, unbiblical counseling, harsh speech, abusive treatment, and any other manifestation of sinful relationships. And they actively seek to protect counselees from harm through their own persistent sin.”\\nThat’s what ACBC believes, and I believe that reflects what the Bible teaches. We have to think about safety.\\nWe want to think about hope. We talked about this in Hebrews 4:12. We have a sympathetic high priest in the Lord Jesus who sympathizes with us—not just in His omniscience, not just because he knows everything, but as the God-man who was afflicted, who was tempted in all things as we are, who was clearly abused—verbally, physically—and yet without sin, the Bible tells us. That text tells us we can come to Jesus who sympathizes with us. What a message! The Son of God cares about you, cares about your abuse, and can relate to your abuse. Not only can He relate, He can help. He can help in a way that no one else in the universe can help because He’s King Jesus. He’s the Son of God. He has grace and mercy to help and we need to help our counselees to see that.\\nWe have to think about reporting laws. You need to know the reporting laws in your state. Biblical counselors and biblical Christians honor the state, which means we follow reporting laws. If you don’t know the reporting laws, talk to your pastor, talk to your elders, and you need to report abuse when it is required by law or when it is otherwise wise and helpful.\\nIntervention. It’s so important to intervene as well to the offender and others involved. We want to minister to the victim, certainly, but we want to think about children too. We want to think about the the abuser and other family members.\\nThis is the ministry plan that I would suggest: Someone takes the lead in biblical counseling (this could be in someone from a small group, kind of a Titus 2 mentor). If the biblical counselor is not an elder and pastor, there needs to be a pastor or elder overseeing that process. The civil authorities need to be involved in certain situations. The rest of the church can also serve in practical needs. These are all ways that we might be able to help.\\nWe also need a major on building a relationship of trust. Proverbs 27:9 says that a man’s counsel is sweet to his friend. Remember, an abuse victim has been hurt in many cases by a close family member, which means that building trust in the counseling relationship may take more time. We need to be very sensitive to that.\\nHow are we going to help her? We’re going to help her by dealing with her own heart and hurt, and actively pursuing God in the Scriptures. I love to use the Psalms to connect hurting people with the things of God, with the person of God. The Psalms meet you in your experience and they take you to God.\\nSecondly, we want to help anchor her identity in Christ. Abuse can become a person’s identity. We want to help that person to find identity in Christ, thinking about a text like Romans 6, so that they don’t see their identity through the lens of abuse, but through the lens of Jesus.\\nWe want to help her to learn to take her thoughts captive. Help her to begin to renew her mind in practical ways, because there are lies that she’s believing. There is deceit and there can be unhelpful things going on there.\\nDwelling on what is true, returning good for evil. These are principles that you’re going to want to apply. Returning good for evil; don’t be overcome by evil, but learn to overcome evil with good.\\nLearning to live by faith, not fear. Hebrews 11 says fix your eyes on Jesus.\\nLeaning on the body of Christ. This is a whole church endeavor in situations like this. Help her to deal with her own sins. Help her to recognize that there are ways that God wants her to grow and change as well, and we need to help her to see those also.\\nSo many heart issues can be present—fear, anxiety, worry, hopelessness, addictions—whatever she’s struggling with, we want to begin to help her to address her heart.\\nThe second main area we want to help her to think about is help her dealing with the offender. There are very practical ways here. Help her think through, “How does Scripture call me to respond with my words, my actions to protect my children, to flee danger?”\\nListen to Psalm 82:4.\\xa0 This is the heart of God in a situation like this: “Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.” That should resonate in the heart of every Christian. Help them to flee danger, to protect children. Think about getting civil authorities involved. Church leadership also needs to be a part of this, as those shepherds have been given charge over their people. How to be a peacemaker, how to answer foolishness with wisdom—so much more than we have time to talk about here.\\nAll of those are ways we want to help her to think wisely about dealing with her offender.\\nFinally, help her to deal with the situation. There’s so many things we have to think about. One is her living situation. As I mentioned if there’s a dangerous situation, if she does not feel safe, we find a family in the church to let her go stay for a time until we can size up the issue. She can stay there safely until we can meet with the offender, so we can get some biblical counseling going, some pastoral involvement. We don’t want to leave a person in a dangerous situation.\\nWe also want to help them to think about practical biblical issues like roles in the home. The husband’s role, the wife’s role, biblical teaching on divorce and remarriage. We don’t abandon biblical teaching about roles and about marriage and divorce just because we have an abuse situation. We have to think wisely. We have to think pastorally about how we can both help the afflicted, keep them safe, rescue them from danger, and honor the Bible in those other teachings. That requires pastoral wisdom, so we need to get our pastors and elders involved.\\nHelp them deal with unbiblical counseling from others. Figure out who those other sources of counsel are and help them to wisely think about whether that is honoring to the Lord or not.\\nOne very practical issue might be, how do you help a child know how to respond when dad is angry and hurtful? Or when mom is angry and hurtful?\\nJesus is able to intervene and transform even the most difficult of circumstances. Let's look to Him as we seek to minister to both abuse victims and to those who are abusive. Click To Tweet\\nWe need to remember that there is hope as well and ministry needed for the abuser. I would offer as exhibit A for this the Apostle Paul. If you have time later, read Acts 7—that’s the stoning of Stephen, where we see Paul sitting holding the coats of those that are throwing rocks, killing the first martyr. Then in Acts 9, the Lord Jesus meets him dramatically, saves him, transforms him. It was so radical, the text tells us he couldn’t stop preaching about this King Jesus. Even the apostles were freaked out by this guy. “Isn’t that the Christian killer? Isn’t that the Christian abuser?” And God saved him and transformed him by His wonderful grace so that he wrote most of the New Testament. That tells us that there is hope for every abuser, every seemingly hopeless situation.\\nJesus is able to intervene and transform even the most difficult of circumstances.

I am so delighted to have Pam here speaking particularly on this topic of engaging abused women. She goes to Grace Bible Church in Bozeman, Montana. Just before we recorded this podcast, my wife and I actually had a wonderful dinner with Pam and her husband Dan, and I’m so grateful to hear the ministry that they’re doing there.\\nPam is an ACBC certified member. One of the things that you need to know about her as well is at our 2018 Annual Conference, Pam shared with us her testimony and story. To me, it is one of the most impactful, moving expressions of the beauty of God’s grace, compassion, kindness, and mercy. Pam, I’m so grateful to be here with you for us to record this podcast to talk about this very difficult issue that is certainly growing in our society. Thank you so much for your message at the Annual Conference and also being here and being willing to talk about this issue.\\nPam Gannon:\\xa0My pleasure.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0As we think about engaging abused women, sometimes we’re a bit nervous to do that. We have questions like, “How should the church should manage and handle this? What is the church’s role and responsibility? How do we navigate some of the issues relative to legal responsibilities?” We’ve done a lot of podcasts talking about some of those distinctions and they’re helpful and we need to move in those directions.\\nSometimes those fears of what not to do or thinking, “We’re going to do this wrongly,” keep us from engaging in real ministry. You’ve engaged with a lot of ladies who are being abused. I think it’s important for us to consider and to know it’s our responsibility as biblical Christians to engage ladies—or any victim of abuse—where they are. As we think about engaging abuse victims, what kind of things do we need to understand in order to engage those who have been abused (abused women in particular) with compassion and grace and mercy?\\nPam Gannon:\\xa0That’s a great question. Each person is obviously unique, but abused people do have some common struggles that we need to be aware of. They’re fearful. They’re ashamed. They have feelings of guilt for what they’re going through or have gone through. They might be angry. They might be in despair and feel helpless. They’re probably going to be having trouble with all kinds of relationships—they don’t quite know how to do them. There’s misunderstandings about trust and love. They’re confused about life and how to do it, and we’re going to have to address all those issues at some point in our counseling.\\nBut when you first meet, you can see typically that these are just broken people. They belong in the “weak” and the “fainthearted” categories that we find in 1 Thessalonians 5:14. They are afraid and they’re likely afraid of you. They want to protect themselves and they’re afraid to be hurt again. They want to know that you are a safe person, that you’re not going to crush them with how you approach them or what you say. They tend to be afraid of sudden noises or movements. You’ll see them startle very easily. So you may want to meet in a quieter place with minimal distractions. They’re afraid of being controlled by others, so we’ve got to keep that in mind and be super gentle with them. They may be afraid to sleep, so they might be coming in exhausted. I mean, there are lots of things to think about with women who are fearful.\\nThen they tend to be ashamed—they don’t even almost look at you when you first meet with them. They just look down the whole time. And that’s okay, as they gain trust they’re going to glance at you more and more. They’re ashamed because sometimes they have been led to believe that the abuse is their fault if they’re in it now, or if it’s happened to them in the past. They carry the blame and shame for that. Oftentimes the perpetrator tells them that actually, that they are at fault here. They’re ashamed if it is a sexual nature to talk about the intimate details. They may want to just imagine and pretend it’s not real.\\nThey’re confused. They don’t know why God would allow these bad things, why other people didn’t help them. They’re asking, “Who’s going to help me now? Are you really going to help me? How do I relate to people? I don’t fit in.” They don’t understand oftentimes what love looks like, because love has been used in wrong ways with them. They’re confused about guilt and innocence and they’re being trained by evil in their conscience. Their conscience needs complete retraining.\\nSo they’re afraid, they’re confused, and they’re ashamed. And because that’s true, they may be doing all kinds of things to try to escape the thoughts of the bad things. One of the things that I would recommend is just try not to be shocked by some of the things that they tell you or what they have done to handle the past. You have to look underneath what they’re telling you. Look underneath the sin and see the pain, because they’re using those sinful escape methods a lot of times because they believe that’s going to help them and relieve their pain. Sometimes they tell you shocking things, so be ready for that.\\nThey may test you, actually, because they don’t trust people oftentimes. They might test you by looking and being angry when you didn’t expect them to be angry, or avoiding you. That will surprise you. So persevere, this is not a quick fix. It’s not an easy thing. It’s going to take them some time to see why what they’re doing is wrong and destructive. Also another caution I would say, because they’re so afraid and ashamed, is that they’re going to feel very condemned at correction, because they’re already full of shame. Correct them very very gently.\\nScripture tells us that weak and fainthearted people need help, comfort, and encouragement. And so we uphold them. Click To Tweet\\nScripture tells us that weak and fainthearted people need help, comfort, and encouragement. And so we uphold them. That’s what we need to do.\\nDale Johnson: Listening to you describe that really helps me as a counselor in how we approach someone who is weak and timid at the moment that we’re helping to overcome some of their predispositions, because when they respond in anger they’re waiting for that to be a trigger for somebody to lash out in abuse or harsh language. We need to be able to come in calm, with compassion, being willing to correct, but to do it in a way that understands where that person is and how they’ve been treated consistently—whether right or wrong. That really helps to bring us back to a point of center, to see through the lens of Christ with deep compassion for the person and meet them where they are.\\nSo you’ve convinced us that we can engage and this is how we should do it. This is the disposition that we should have, knowing some of the predispositions that someone who’s been abused may come in with. They’ve overcome a lot of fears and lack of trust to come into the office, and so now what do we do? What are some of the key elements in our counseling approach to help and engage this abuse victim?\\nPam Gannon:\\xa0I think the very first thing you want to do is reassure them that they’re not alone anymore, because you’re there and you love them. Let them know they don’t have to manage this crisis alone. A lot of abused people do not report the crimes done against them, and if they haven’t reported it to anyone, they’re going to have felt alone for a long time. You want to reassure them that you’re going to help, you’re going to be there. And God is going to help. God is near to the brokenhearted and He saves those who are crushed in spirit (Psalm 34:18). He heals the brokenhearted He binds up their wounds (Psalm 147:3). Scripture’s truth is beautiful.\\nYou might want to tell them, “I’m going to walk with you and I want to be helpful to you. That’s my goal. I want to bring you the best help that there is in God, so that you can become the person that He wants you to be.”\\nNext, you have to listen with compassion. You have to give them lots of time to tell their story. You have to be exceedingly patient and kind. I think a mistake sometimes we can make is to push too hard and too fast for information. Remember it’s going to take somebody a long time to deal with the crime and its aftermath. Because of their difficulty in trusting people, they may not trust you right away. You can tell them, “I don’t want to add to your hurt unnecessarily, so I’m not going to push you to tell me things beyond what you’re okay with telling me at this point.” I’m going to actually let them know that, and usually they’ll come a point where they are ready to share with me.\\nWhen they do tell you about that abuse, when they do share with you what’s going on, you have to really watch your countenance. Don’t look shocked. Be grieved—be very grieved. Gently show them your sorrow, but try not to look shocked. That’s going to scare them. Weep with them. You’re going to share their sorrow. Be willing to step into the grief and the ugliness of the evil you’re going to hear about. When we share their burden, we’re now bearing it with them as Christ tells us to in Galatians 6:2 (“bear one another’s burdens”). I think it was Bob Kelleman who said, “Shared sorrow is endurable sorrow,” and I think that’s right. You might tell them, “I am so sorry that you have gone through this.” To express our sorrow in that way is not denying the goodness of God’s sovereignty in using suffering for good, it’s just simply acknowledging that there is real damage here and there’s destruction that sin causes.\\nAs they tell their story, be careful not to deny it or question if it happened. Believe them unless there’s good evidence to the contrary. Think about it: It takes a lot of courage to walk into the counseling room and to finally share what’s feeling so shameful to them. Try not to close them down with expressions of disbelief. You can appropriately show them what it’s like to be angry and not sin.\\nWhen I’m explaining to counselors, I’ll often use the Tamar story to explain to them how they should not be responding to these stories of abuse. You may know the story about Tamar. That was David’s daughter. She had a brother named Absalom and a half-brother named Amnon. And Amnon had strong sexual desires for Tamar. He deceived her, violated her by force, and then threw her out. Tamar went away crying loud. Then David, her father, found out and he was angry, but he didn’t do anything. He was passive. Absalom found out and after two years, he took the opportunity to kill Amnon. Obviously neither of those is a good response. I think the right response for counselors is to be angry and let that anger motivate you to help your counselee seek justice and not vengeance. Your response of godly anger can be comforting. They can see there is a way to be angry about this that is appropriate, and there are appropriate ways—righteous ways, even—to express it.\\nDale Johnson: I think the topic of justice is an important one for us. We want to strive for what God’s strives for. He is certainly the judge of all the earth. He will do what’s right, and He is a just God. For us to long for that for those who have been oppressed and those who have been taken advantage of is absolutely appropriate. For us to even be angry in a righteous way at what’s happened, what’s been done to them, is appropriate because it is a wicked thing. It is an evil thing. I think that’s very healthy for us. We’re helping set the counselee up in a way to identify what God says is evil and what God says is good, and say, “What you’ve gone through is in the category of evil and God sees it as such.”\\nWe want to deal with real life, and the Bible is not afraid to represent real, raw questions—questions that people have because of experience that they’re walking through in life. Sometimes those are hard questions to answer. In a situation of abuse, a frequent question is, “We see that God is good in the Scriptures. We hear people proclaim all the time that He’s good. Why would He allow these things to happen?” What are some of the principles that you might utilize to navigate this type of question?\\nPam Gannon: That’s a great question because we do get that question frequently. I think what we want to do is help the person see that God’s Word actually gives us wisdom to deal with that question. First, I want to talk about what we do know about God, that’s probably where I’ll start. I’ll start with, “We do know that God is good, He’s sovereign, He’s wise, He’s holy, and perfect in all His ways. And He’s never the author of wrong.” You can point them to Genesis 3, which shows that it wasn’t until man chose the way of Satan—rather than the way of God—that evil and suffering entered the world. The suffering and sorrow that we are seeing, that they are facing, is not the work of an unkind God, but it’s a consequence of sin, because sin brought suffering and destruction into the world. We do know that.\\nWhen they’re confused and angry about that, they have to place their blame for it squarely on man’s sin. I think suffering, if we look at it rightly, actually gives us a glimpse of the evilness of sin. It really does. It helps us see why a perfect God hates it. That’s where I would start is to say what we do know about God.\\nThen I would tell them, frankly there are many things we don’t know. I’m going to talk about the fact that it’s okay not to know the precise answers to “Why?” question. God doesn’t actually require us to understand things that He has not revealed. Beyond the general understanding of why suffering is in the world, which we’ve just told them, we can’t always know. There are secret things—it’s a Deuteronomy 29:29 issue, which says, “The secret things belong to the Lord our God.” There are things that we know and that we can trust that we do know about God, but many things we won’t know.\\nWe cannot possibly understand all the ways of God. His ways are far greater than we can grasp. But He has revealed to us enough, He's given us enough to enable us to live life well to His glory. Click To Tweet\\nSometimes I use this analogy—I actually use this a lot in counseling—and I try to explain it like this. Suppose that you came across an anthill. Let’s say that I drew a line across an ant’s path or I disrupted the sand in some way. The ant would have no idea what just happened and it would just start running around doing ant things to fix it. It wouldn’t even know I was there—it can’t fathom my life. Now suppose though that I wanted to explain my life to this ant. Suppose that I wanted to explain computers and air travel and stars. I can’t possibly explain those things to an ant, and why not? Because it has an ant brain. It’s incapable of understanding the ways of people and the universe. If I could become an ant, I might be able to communicate to it in some ways, but I’m always going to be limited because of their imperfect capacity for knowledge. That’s okay, because the ant knows all it needs to know in order to function as an ant. In a similar way, we are creatures with just human brains. We cannot possibly understand all the ways of God. His ways are far greater than we can grasp. But He has revealed to us enough, He’s given us enough to enable us to live life well to His glory.\\nI would sum up my answer to their question by pointing out that what we do know is enough. Humility accepts the fact that we live with unanswered questions, but God has revealed to us everything that we need to know (2 Peter 1:3-4). That’s the approach I would use to help strugglers deal with questions that arise in the face of evil that’s been done to them.\\nDale Johnson: That’s such an important point when we think about God in His grace, mercy, and ability to restore. It’s not a prerequisite that we know why. Thank you for the encouragement, Pam. This is so helpful, certainly as we as counselors are going to continue to deal with this type of situation more. We need to be bold, but we need to be compassionate in the way that Christ did. I think you’ve expressed that very well. So thank you for for encouraging us in this way.\\nPam Gannon: My pleasure.\\nRecommended Resources\\nA Testimony of God’s Grace in the Aftermath of Abuse – Pam Gannon\\nCounseling a Fearful and Abused Wife – Pam Gannon\\n\\nTo read ACBC’s Statement on Abuse and Biblical Counseling visit our Committed to Care website.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAbuse\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

There were years when I looked within myself for strength and sought after control to alleviate my feelings of helplessness and fear of getting hurt again (whether emotionally or physically). However, in my pursuit of control, I found that I was the one being controlled—by my emotions. Whatever I was feeling determined my reality and impacted my decisions, making it difficult to live the stable, biblically wise life I was called to as a child of God.\\nI’m thankful for the opportunity to share a little about what I’ve found in Scripture on this subject, although I wish I could sit down and talk with you over coffee instead! I hope that this post and the gospel will encourage you to know that we are not at the mercy of how we feel. We do not have to be enslaved by our emotions.\\nAbuse Complicates Emotions\\nFor those of us who have been abused the God-given gift of emotions can often feel like a curse. Our feelings can cause us to relive past trauma or make us feel unsafe and powerless. Fear can be a constant unwanted companion who infiltrates so many of our thoughts. However, the good news is that God’s Word provides the guidance and counsel that we need for how to navigate through our (often-complicated) emotions and feelings.\\nSorting Through Feelings\\nJeremiah 17:9 says, “The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick; who can understand it?” Our hearts are deceitful and cannot be trusted. Consequently, the feelings and emotions which flow from our hearts cannot be relied upon as an ultimate standard of truth. Rather, Scripture must be our standard of truth. It is through the lens of God’s Word and the hope of the gospel that we are able to sort through our feelings well. When we begin with God as our starting point, Scripture clarifies to us what is real and reliable and what isn’t.\\nSara’s Life\\nHere is an example of how this might play out in real life. Let’s consider my counselee, Sara, who was struggling with intense feelings of sadness and shame after abuse in her youth years. She felt as though she would never be able to get past the grief of what had been taken from her or let go of the crushing weight of shame.\\nI began counseling her with the same truth I studied for myself in college when I was working through my past; the lovingkindness of God. All of Scripture is weaving together a story of God’s perfect and selfless love. Studying this perfect love has two major implications for dealing with grief after abuse; 1. We realize that because God is perfectly loving everything He has allowed us to experience in His sovereign will is for our ultimate good; that we could become more like Christ. Through a growth in wisdom and righteousness we are able to experience the goodness and joy which flows from a life of worship (Hebrews 12:4-11, Romans 8:28-29). 2. We learn God’s love is so vast and full it is powerful enough to heal our brokenness. Christ was sent to “bring good news to the afflicted; He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to captives and freedom to prisoners” (Isaiah 61:1).\\nIf we refuse to trust in the lovingkindness of God and instead rely on our own strength to be “okay” we will never find healing. Sara was lost in her suffering because she didn’t know the depth of God’s love for her. When she began to trust in God as her savior, stronghold, refuge, rock, shield, and strength she found the courage to work through her feelings of grief (Psalm 18:1-3, 33:18-22, 62:5-8).\\nLamentations 3:17-26 was life changing for Sara because she realized she didn’t need to seek control by minimizing her emotional pain to feel stronger. Instead she could allow herself to experience all of her pain because there was no depth of emotional darkness powerful enough to steal away her hope; because it was built on knowing and trusting God. She learned to say, “This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope. The LORD’S lovingkindesses indeed never cease, for His compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. “The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “Therefore I have hope in Him.” God’s love is powerful to heal and give us hope no matter the depth of our sorrows.\\nBut what about Sara’s struggle with shame? Because God’s Word speaks of both sin that we have committed, as well as sin that has been committed against us it was helpful to take time separating out the two from her past. For the first category, Scripture shows us the pathway to complete removal of guilt and shame from the sins that we have committed comes through repentance and turning to God in worship (1 John 1:9, Psalm 103:1-12, Hebrews 10:15-23, Psalm 32:1-5). The truth is that even though we might be the one who was initially wronged or hurt, our sinful human hearts are prone to sin in thought and deed in response. In Sara’s case, it was difficult for her to take ownership of her own sin when she had been wronged so severely. We focused on how the gospel sets us free from the power and enslavement of sin. Even when we have been significantly sinned against by others we do not have to sin in response. Nothing and no one can force us to sin. In light of this truth she found freedom in the truth that her abuser didn’t hold power over her, and through repentance a weight was lifted.\\nScripture also addresses a second category of sin (that which is done against us). It is clear we are never responsible for someone else’s sin (Ezekiel 18:20) and that each person will stand before God to give an account for their actions alone (Romans 14:10-12). Therefore, we do not need to carry the burden of shame for another’s sin and must refuse to do so.\\nIt took time, but Sara was able to change; instead of feelings controlling her reality, truth became her firm foundation. She daily reminded herself of God’s lovingkindness, embraced forgiveness for her sin through the gospel, and refused to carry shame that didn’t belong to her.\\nJust because something feels true doesn’t mean that it is! For many abuse victims, our reality can often be determined by our emotions but this doesn’t have to be the case as we reshape our thinking to have our standard of truth built on Scripture.\\nA Genesis 4:3-8 Perspective on Emotions\\nAnother aspect of emotions that is helpful to consider is the relationship between our circumstances, feelings, and choices. We don’t have control over what happens to us in life, but as believers we do have a choice in how we respond. We can either choose what is right as an act of worship to God or choose sinfully as an act of worship to our idols. But what role do feelings play as we navigate through the circumstances of life?\\nThe world teaches us that if we make choices based on how we feel we will get what we want (“if I follow my heart and do what feels good, I will be happy”). This belief system is shown in the following progression:\\nCircumstance\\xa0→ Feelings\\xa0→ Choice\\xa0→ Outcome.\\nNon-believers have no other option than to live based on how they feel and in reaction to whatever happens to them. They are a slave to their hearts’ desires. For example, if the uncontrollable circumstance I have experienced is abuse, that makes me feel unsafe and if my idol is security I will make choices to protect that idol. Such as never allowing myself to be vulnerable in relationships in order to achieve that which I desire most; feeling safe. Without God we have no other choice but to live based on how we feel in an effort to protect our idols.\\nBecause of the gospel this is not our only option and Genesis 4 helps us to understand that our circumstances don’t have power over us because our choices should be based on what is right, not on how we feel.\\nIn this passage we see that Cain reacts with anger because God accepted his brother’s offering and rejected his. In response, God asks Cain in verse 6, “Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you. But you must master it.” Even though He already knew the answer, God began with two questions in order to draw out Cain’s heart. These questions should have caused Cain to consider why he was so angry. What did he want more in that moment than pleasing God?\\nNext, God clearly explains Cain had a choice to do what is right which would lead to better feelings (“will not your countenance be lifted up?”). On the other hand, the opposite would be true if Cain chose to continue to live for himself. A life of sin might give momentary pleasure but always will be a downward spiral leading to death (Romans 6:23). Whereas a life of worship leads to life and life abundantly (Jeremiah 17:5-9, John 10:10). God was teaching Cain he had a choice to do right or wrong and his feelings would be dependent upon that choice. From this passage, we see that the true progression is:\\nCircumstance\\xa0→ Choice\\xa0→ Feelings\\xa0→ Outcome\\nAlthough we don’t have control over the circumstances of our lives, because of the gospel we can choose what is right, even when it is difficult. Feelings don’t have control over us. We can choose righteousness and experience the blessings and positive feelings which flow from a life of worship (Proverbs 3:13-18).\\nFeelings Don’t Have Power Over Us\\nAre you beginning to understand the profound effect these truths have on those of us who have experienced some of life’s most cruel circumstances? We are not at the mercy of what has happened to us because our circumstances don’t have the power to control how we feel and our emotions don’t have control over what we do. Our feelings don’t interpret our reality. Through the gospel we have been given the ability to have hope in the midst of grief, choose what is right no matter the circumstance (Romans 6:4-11), and experience the abundant blessings that come from a life of worship. If God were not real, we would have no choice but to be controlled by our emotions, constantly living in reaction to the uncontrollable circumstances of life.\\nPraise God that because we belong to Him, we have been set free from the power of sin and through faith are able to choose what is right even when we have been hurt! It is in Him alone we are set free and find healing, hope, and joy.\\n\\nTo read ACBC’s Statement on Abuse and Biblical Counseling visit our Committed to Care website.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAbuse\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAliza Hawkins is an ACBC certified counselor and serves on staff at Lighthouse Community Church in California.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Destigmatizing Addiction', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 495', 'author': 'Dale Johnson  Mark Shaw', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'Why is stigma damaging and how can we define addiction in light of Scripture?', 'body': 'Dale Johnson: This week on a podcast, I have with me Dr. Mark Shaw. He’s a pastor of counseling at the Nocatee campus of First Baptist Church in Jacksonville, Florida. He’s the founder of The Addiction Connection, a non-profit equipping ministry for addiction for biblical counselors. He’s the author of 28 Publications, including The Heart of Addiction, and the latest one, which we’re going to talk about today, called Destigmatizing Addiction: Hope Through the Gospel. His passion is to see local church offer compassionate biblical counseling to hurting souls. Mark, you’re familiar to many of our listeners. We are so glad that you’re with us to talk about this important booklet that you’ve released. Welcome to podcast today.\\nMark Shaw: Thanks Dale. I’m grateful to be here.\\nDale Johnson: Now, we could go a lot of different directions as we think about stigma. If we were to just talk on a plane secular level, Mark, and have this conversation, stigmas are probably the one-great-problem. Well, there are lots of problems in the mental health world, but this is one of the primary problems that the mental health world knows that they’ve created, and they don’t know how to get rid of it. Because at some point when you say that someone is abnormal, you create some level of stigmatization. I want us to dive in because you’re pinpointing this area in terms of addiction. You do a lot of addiction ministry, and so, I want us to explore this idea of stigmatization. What do we mean? Let’s start by describing it this way: God actually, I would say, hates this idea of stigma, in part because people are made in His image. So, describe in the booklet how you unpack this idea of stigmatization and why this would be something that’s disturbing to the heart of God.\\nMark Shaw: Yeah, I totally agree. It’s an addiction issue. It’s a mental health issue. It’s both of those because of the terminology they’ve created, like you just said. They’ve created terminology and this created stigma. And I think when you talk about stigma, it really means to stain someone’s reputation. I think about proverbs 22:1, “A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches.” So, God obviously is giving us wisdom there about our reputation. And when you stigmatize people, it’s an attempt to make them less than human, you know, less than you. It’s a prideful thing to say, “Man, those drug addicts…” “or those bipolar…” You know? And people are typically looking down on someone when they stigmatize them. And I just believe, like you said, the Lord hates that. And the devil, when you think about diablos, is a slanderer. He’s falsely accusing the brethren, and gossip and all of that is slanderous to people’s character. So, I think it’s a big deal. And I think what’s great is we have the answer in the gospel, from the hope of Jesus Christ.\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, I think that’s exactly right. It is interesting as you described, how the world created this idea of labeling. And as they create this idea of labeling, again describing something that’s abnormal: There was an unintended consequence of creating this idea of stigmatization. And again, if you go back and read the literature regarding mental health for its history, what you see is that this is has been one of the primary problems they’ve had to face. They’ve dumped billions and billions into PR programs to try and undo this idea of stigma—trying to normalize, you know, the labels that people have. So much so, that now we’re starting to go down a different direction with these ideas of stigma, to where now we’re saying we’re normalizing everyday life. In our medicalization of everyday life, we’re trying to normalize the problems that people have. Well, what that means then is now we’re not talking about abnormalities. We’re not talking about things that are distinct from what we typically experience in a given day. So, I want you to elaborate a little bit on how the world’s terminology actually creates a stigma for an individual rather than alleviates it.\\nMark Shaw: Yeah, the world thinks that they’re kinder than God and that they can do better than God. So, they reject biblical words like drunkard, for example, and they want to say: “Well, you’re an alcoholic, you have this disease, you have this disorder, it’s not your fault.” Now they do say you have to take responsibility for that disease and treat it by going to AA meetings or whatever. And all that’s really behavioral, it’s not biochemical or anything. And so, in the world would you see terms like addict, junkie, and crackhead. And now, even addict is a rejected term. So, it’s an idea that they came up with, but now they can’t solve a problem of stigma. But we can when we use biblical language that says, “hey we’re all sinners. We’re all sinners, and some sin God labels.” And the Bible, you know, it kind of characterizes you like: If you’re a drunkard, you’re characterized by that behavior. But the great news is you see your responsibility in it, your need for Christ and salvation, and then sanctification, and spiritual growth. So, I love how our language, the language of the Bible, is superior. And that’s the battle that I think’s going on in biblical counseling movement right now is: It’s a terminology battle. And those terms are embedded with greater truths. Like when you use addiction, its embedded with the idea of disease and then also embedded into that term, is the idea of being a victim. And if I’m a victim and I didn’t cause this, then something had to cause it. And so, a lot of people are going to trauma and say, “Well it’s trauma, and so people need trauma-informed care,” and all this. And as biblical counselors, we reject those words because of the embedded ideas and theories of man that are false and don’t line up with Scriptural truths.\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, that’s exactly right. I mean, this terminology matters. It means something when we use, you know, the idea of trauma-informed or addiction as you described. And we are caught sort of in the middle: We want people to know that we’re describing that there are biblical truths and biblical hope for using such terminology. But before we go on to talking about how the labels that the Scripture gives actually provide proper inditement on some of the problems that we have as people, dealing with legitimate guilt and shame that we experience as human beings. But it also provides hope with that language. That’s a moral disposition. I want to go back, you said something that was very intriguing to me where you described that the secular world created the idea of “the addict”, but now they’re moving away from it. And I think what you’re going to describe—I don’t know this—I’m eager to hear what you’re going to say. But it’s not shocking to me that that’s the case, because secular philosophy always at some point turns in on itself. And it realizes that they can’t provide the answer with that language. Because ultimately what happens is now the person who is an addict, if it is a “disease,” then they’re associated with something that now becomes out of their control and is biological and biochemical and so on. So, I want you to get back to that statement. I was very intrigued by that. What did you mean that they stopped using or they want to stop using this idea of addict? What’s the problem with it and where they trying to move?\\nMark Shaw: Now, they think that terms like addict are stigmatizing—which is their term—and they are, and that people are rejecting help because they don’t want to be stigmatized as an addict. So, they see that as a barrier to treatment. I’m talking the addiction world. And so, people aren’t asking for help because nobody wants to be stigmatized as an addict, you know, with this disease. And they’ve created all this thinking they were kinder than God and that they’ve solved it. And it’s really created more problems for them, which is why I love the biblical approach to counseling. We offer true, hope and true freedom in Christ and the new identity in Christ. It’s awesome.\\nDale Johnson: Yeah. And I mean, that’s a really key distinction that I think is very helpful: If they were attempting to identify things that people struggle with, on some level distancing the person from any, you know, real legitimate personal responsibility. But yet, still that language becomes stigmatizing. And yet in the Scriptures, you know, the Lord is unafraid to call us by who we really are. In fact, the Scriptures described it. It’s the only thing known to man that can help us to see the type of people we really are, and it will call us out for the ways in which we’re not living in the way God made us—which is to honor and glorify Him. And when we choose other pleasures, like what happens in terms of addiction, the Lord—He calls us out on how we’ve walked away from Him and what to call these issues of sin and the difficulty that comes along with the consequences of choosing this way. And so, we definitely prefer biblical language, not just because it better describes what’s happening, but also, Mark, because it actually leaves the door open for redemption and hope that’s radically different than recovery or an identity being rooted in something that’s biochemical in my body. I want you to talk a little bit about biblical language and how biblical language actually conveys something about God that doesn’t leave us in a hopeless state, like the secular labels do. It actually conveys something radically different in terms of hope\\nMark Shaw: Language is so important because it communicates the love of God. I mean God invented language. It belongs to Him. And so, as biblical counselors, we want to convey a love of God to the people we serve. And it’s much more loving, like you just pointed out, to say, “Hey, you have an idolatry problem.” People think idolatry is a harsh word; Idolatry is a great word because it tells people that, “Hey, there’s only one true God. And He is the only one who can save you and can transform you and give you hope to be different.” And so that’s really the love of God. To me, that’s why language is so important. I want to be an agent of love to the people that I serve, and I do that best with biblical language, not secular terms and secular ideas. Biblical language conveys the heart of God and His character, that God is love.\\nDale Johnson: I love the way that you’re helping us to see that. And one final thought—we were talking today about a new booklet that you have released. And I’m really excited about Destigmatizing Addiction: Hope Through the Gospel. Give us a sense, Mark, on two things. The first thing is: Why was it important to write such a little booklet to help our readers? And then the second is: What are the primary things that you hope that they take away from this booklet?\\nMark Shaw: You know, I write a story that kind of continues on throughout the booklet. And I love that story because it’s not real, but it’s based on real conversations and interactions I’ve had about how there is a difference in the two approaches of a secular approach and a biblical approach. And in the booklet, this young lady is trying to convince her pastor, “We’ve got to bring this stuff into the church. We’ve got to start helping addicts, we’re not doing that.” And he, you know, in the story, flips it and helps her to see that there really is clarity—that these are two different approaches, and they’re not compatible. And so, with the booklet that’s one thing I want to bring us some clarity to. But then the second thing is, again, the hope and the love that’s offered in Jesus Christ in biblical truth. And so, I have even an appendix at the end that talks about the hopeless disease addiction language, and biblical truth and love presented, just to give people the difference. And there are two separate languages that I’m concerned about the biblical counseling movement blending is attempting to blend those two things together, and making it confusing and unclear. So that’s really the big purpose of the booklet\\nDale Johnson: Okay, listen brother, I love it. And I think this has been a helpful resource that you’re contributing here. I so appreciate how you think in terms of this whole secular realm of addiction and how you’re bringing biblical truth to bear—not just simply as a force of remedy, but also in how we label these things that help us to see the beauty of the treasures of wisdom and knowledge found in Christ—that we can run to hope. And that people can, not just have this as an Identity for the rest of their life, but they can actually be redeemed, changed and live a life that’s full of peace and hope, longing for what’s to come—where we will be eradicated from sin once and forever. And I appreciate your work here. I want to recommend this booklet that you’ve labored over Mark and thanks for your time today. Appreciate it brother.\\nMark Shaw: Thank you, Dale.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

As he labored through a couple of stats to argue in favor of Lebron James, I let him “take the line” and just “set the hook” as I pulled up a YouTube video that compared all his stats against Michael Jordan. As a kid who grew up in the Chicago area, it is no surprise that I was in favor of MJ. The most staggering stats were from the NBA Finals. Michael Jordan never lost! The facts were, the bigger the stage, the better he played, which was the exact opposite for Lebron. These statistics did not even take into consideration all the intangibles of leadership and drive.\\xa0 Everyone thinks and wants their icon (or idol) to be the best.\\xa0\\nI realized something as I thought about our conversation: man loves glory. Humans love to search for glory to enjoy and obtain. From sports icons and highlight reels to beauty pageants to amazing animal shows to food competitions, every channel we turn to on television hooks us through glory. That is not to mention that the commercials in between the glory shows are also selling us glory as well: the high life, the toughest Ford truck, the best jewelry, the most extravagant travel destination, etc. Why is a multi-billion-dollar industry structured in this way?\\xa0 Because it works! Why does it work? Because humans are wired to worship glory.\\xa0\\nWorship Designed\\xa0\\nAs you read the account of creation in Genesis 1, you cannot help but notice the same phrase at the end of each day, “it was good.”\\xa0 What this phrase means is that God’s creation perfectly reflected the character or glory of its Maker. God is a glorious God. God created man and designed man in such a way that he craves glory. He loves God’s creation and sees and worships God through his interaction with God’s creation. This is what we read about in Psalm 19. Creation is speaking about the Creator. These lesser glories are to point us to the greatest glory in our God. So, as 1 Corinthians 10:31 states, even eating and drinking should be done in a way that recognizes and gives glory to God. We use and enjoy the gifts as we praise and enhance our relationship with the giver; however, this compulsion for glory and excitement can be dangerous when God is no longer who we are trying to please or worship. Anytime we glorify creation over the Creator, we are heading into addiction. That is exactly what happened in Genesis 3.\\xa0\\nWorship Distorted\\xa0\\nAs we come to the Fall in Genesis 3, we see something very significant happening there. For the first time in history humans looked to creation to bring them glory of their own. Genesis 3:5 “For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” The major shift here was the creation was no longer enjoyed to the glory of God, but now man would look to creation to be god. Man would look for creation’s glory to be his alone in the worship of self. This was the beginning of humanism or the worship of man.\\xa0 Since this time fallen, mankind has sought to garner every pleasure he can out of creation without any thought of the God who created and owns all they have consumed out of creation as they worship self. This is the real ugliness of idolatry. All idolatry is truly worship of self, and it is the beginning of chasing after what will never satisfy. Humans are designed for glory but addicted to the pleasure they can get for themselves out of creation. Mankind cannot stop worshipping just as they cannot stop breathing air! It’s how they are designed. The question is, are they breathing clean air or polluted air? Or are they worshipping the Holy God or lesser, corrupting gods like self? Romans 1 tells us that God gives us over to the lusts of our flesh as we seek to worship the creation over the Creator (Romans 1:21-25). This is the theology and reason for addiction!\\xa0\\nWorship Re-directed\\xa0\\nHow does one fix this addiction problem and the direction of their life? The interesting thing about worship is it is not just something we do but it is something we become. It is the direction we are headed. It is clear in Scripture that as we see the glory of God we are being changed into the same image (2 Corinthians 3:18). God allows us to see the revelation of Himself in the Bible and more specifically in Jesus. As a matter of fact, 2 Corinthians 4:6 tells us that just as he called light to shine out of darkness, He shows us the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ. As we see His glory, we admire Him. His character is noble and beautiful. As we delight in this, we desire Him (Psalm 37:4). We begin to love what He loves and hate what he hates. This drives our choices and soon we acquire Him. As 2 Corinthians 3:18 states, as we see His glory we are changed into it. G. K. Beale said, “We become what we worship for ruin or for restoration”. This is exactly what God said all throughout the Old Testament. God said the children of Israel became like the ox they worshipped. Psalm 106:19-21 tells us that “they made a calf in Horeb and worshiped a metal image. They exchanged the glory of God for the image of an ox that eats grass. They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt.”\\xa0\\nIn the New Testament, the Jews wanted political freedom from the Romans, which made them very excited for the Messiah to come. They wanted the Messiah to do their bidding or fix their problems, but that was not why He came. He came to free them from their worship of self and the sin they were pursuing that had them in bondage just like their forefathers in Egypt. They didn’t need someone to fix their external problems, they needed true freedom from sin and the enslavement that came from their distorted worship. The reason people today do not get freedom from addiction is because addiction is worship, and we will never stop worshipping. Addiction (worship) is not the problem. The problem is what are they addicted to?\\xa0 If we are addicted to the glory of God, we will be changed into His image.\\xa0 If men are addicted to creation and the glory that he can get out of it, he will be destroyed by his sin, as he robs God of the glory He deserves (James 1:14-15). According to Isaiah 42:8, God tells us that He will not share His glory with anything or anyone else in this way: “I am the Lord; that is my name; my glory I give to no other, nor my praise to carved idols.”\\xa0\\nTherefore, the only way to overcome enslavement of worshiping creation is to worship the God of glory, which is what we are created for and our source of true satisfaction, peace, and joy. This is the blessed life of contentment in our Creator. May we point one another and our counselees to the true hope and help that Asaph found in the living God— “Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you” (Psalm 73:25).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJack Lezza II has been serving at Independent Baptist Church in Bolingbrook, IL, for 23 years.

      "{'title': 'An Analysis of the Celebrate Recovery Addictions Program', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Eric Davis  Matt Mumma', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'As far as a Christ-centered, biblically based program, CR falls significantly short.', 'body': 'Enslaving behaviors are as old, and common to humanity, as sin itself. Since our fall at the dawn of time, we have been naturally enslaved to every destructive behavior possible. In response, various efforts have been made to deal with the problem.\\xa0\\nOne such effort is a packaged addictions program called\\u202fCelebrate Recovery\\u202f(CR). John Baker and Rick Warren of Saddleback Church created the program in 1991 to help people with various addictions. Rick Warren writes, “[D]uring the ten-week series that I preached to kick off this program, our attendance grew by over 1500!”1John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12 During the past 25 years, some 20,000 churches in the United States have reportedly used CR, with some 2.5 million people having completed the program. Needless to say, CR has had a major influence on the church.\\xa0\\nCR’s stated purpose is “to encourage fellowship and to celebrate God’s healing power in our lives as we work our way along the road to recovery”.2John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 21  Further, Warren claims that CR is “more effective in helping people change than anything else I’ve seen or heard of”.3John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12\\nGenerally, the program runs on a one-year repeating schedule. Participants are taken through the material in 25 lessons and testimonies, meeting once per week for 52 weeks. Rick Warren writes that CR was born when “I began an intense study of the Scriptures to discover what God had to say about ‘recovery.’ To my amazement, I found the principles of recovery—in their logical order—given by Christ in His most famous message, the Sermon on the Mount”.4John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12 More specifically, CR teaches that the Beatitudes (Matt. 5:3-12), which are said to be “eight ways to be happy,” contain the progressive path to addiction recovery.\\xa0\\nThe eight principles upon which CR is derived are as follows (the principle is stated, followed by the corresponding Beatitude):\\xa0\\nThe Road to Recovery\\xa0\\n\\nRealize I’m not God; I admit that I am powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and that my life is unmanageable. (Step 1) “Happy are those who know that they are spiritually poor” (Matt. 5:3, though the CR manual cites these verses as the NIV, they are all taken from the GNT).\\u202f\\n\\n\\nEarnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to Him and that He has the power to help me recover. (Step 2) “Happy are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted” (Matt. 5:4).\\u202f\\n\\n\\nConsciously choose to commit all my life and will to Christ’s care and control. (Step 3)\\u202f“Happy are the meek” (Matt. 5:5).\\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\nOpenly examine and confess my faults to myself, to God, and to someone I trust. (Steps 4 and 5)\\u202f“Happy are the pure in heart” (Matt. 5:8).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nVoluntarily submit to any and all changes God wants to make in my life and humbly ask Him to remove my character defects. (Steps 6 and 7) “Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires” (Matt. 5:6).\\u202f\\n\\n\\nEvaluate all my relationships. Offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me and make amends for harm I’ve done to others, when possible, except when to do so would harm them or others. (Steps 8 and 9)\\u202f“Happy are the merciful” (Matt. 5:7). “Happy are the peacemakers” (Matt. 5:9).\\u202f\\xa0\\n\\n\\nReserve a time with God for self-examination, Bible reading, and prayer in order to know God and His will for my life and to gain the power to follow His will. (Steps 10 and 11)\\u202f(no verse cited).\\xa0\\n\\n\\nYield myself to God to be used to bring this Good News to others, both by my example and my words. (Step 12)\\u202f“Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires” (Matt. 5:10).\\xa0\\n\\nClever readers will notice that the first letter from each of the eight steps forms the acronym, “recovery.” CR’s approach takes each of the eight principles and expounds\\u202fthem with a few lessons, forming the 25 lessons in which participants are guided through how to deal with their “hurts, hang-ups, and habits” (the oft-used phrase in CR to describe our problems which need recovery).\\xa0\\nSince CR claims to be Christian in nature, “biblical”5John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 13, grounded in God’s word6John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12 and\\u202f“based on the actual words of Jesus rather than on psychological theory”7John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12, it deserves to be evaluated as such. This review is based upon the program’s teaching as stated in the CR Leadership Guide only (pages cited are from this guide) and is not a critique of every person who has participated in the program. Further, the purpose of this review is not to question whether the 2.5 million participants have felt that they were assisted with enslaving behaviors, nor to doubt the sincerity of individuals seeking to help, but, instead, to examine CR’s claim to be biblically based.\\xa0\\nHaving said that, this review (completed largely\\u202fwith the help of Matthew Mumma, pastor of biblical counseling at Cornerstone Church) will demonstrate that CR contains two major problems: (1) Though claiming to be biblically based, its teachings are often constructed from a misuse of Scripture and an erroneous hermeneutic. (2) Though claiming to be Christian based, its theology often clashes with sound Christian theology.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nMany of CR’s teachings are constructed from a misuse of Scripture and an erroneous hermeneutic.\\xa0\\n\\nThe clearest instance of this occurs in\\u202fthe principles upon which CR is founded. CR’s “Road to Recovery” begins with the “Eight Principles Based on the Beatitudes”8John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12, stated above. Thus, CR claims that the Beatitudes are principles for addiction recovery.\\xa0\\nThis interpretation, however, incorrectly understands the Beatitudes by removing them out of their context and interpreting them in an eisegetical manner. As such, CR imposes a meaning other than the authorial intent upon the text. When Christ preached the Beatitudes, he did not intend for them to be a protocol for recovery. Neither are they “ways to be happy”.9John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 12 Instead, the Beatitudes are descriptions of kingdom citizens; of individuals having been saved by God’s grace. Commentators agree that the Beatitudes describe the common characteristics of true believers\\u202f(e.g. John Blanchard, 54; James Boice, 74; D.A. Carson, 128, 132; D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, 1:24; Charles Quarles, 39).\\u202fJesus begins this great sermon by turning the common understanding of those in God’s favor on its head. The Pharisees, who largely set the religious/spiritual tone of the day, would have propagated the photo-negative of the Beatitudes, and, thus, an incorrect understanding of the believer. For this reason, Jesus brings clarity to the scene with these corrections.\\u202f\\xa0\\nSpecifically, “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (Matt. 5:3) is not a recovery principle, teaching that “I’m not God…powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and that my life is unmanageable”.10John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 9 Instead, Jesus teaches that one certain evidence of the true believer is a poverty of spirit. The word “poor” was used to describe abject poverty and a raggedly covered (if covered at all) beggar, cowered over with head down and hand out (TDNT, 6:886), while “in spirit” refers to our moral/spiritual state. The idea is that the sinner has come to terms with God’s towering moral standards for humanity; absolute perfection (cf.\\u202fMatt. 5:48). Further, he understands that having rebelliously and flagrantly violated God’s holy law, he deserves to endure the righteous wrath of God in hell for eternity. Thus, he comes to God, as nothing more than a head down, hand out, moral beggar, with zero moral/spiritual contribution to God except sin. Being morally filthy, the sinner depends entirely on God’s mercy if he is going to be acceptable to God. So,\\u202fMatthew 5:3\\u202fdoes not teach a principle for recovering from addictions, but that true believers understand that they cannot earn God’s favor from their impressive moral wealth, but have only earned his wrath by their offensive moral filth.\\u202f\\xa0\\nSimilar problems exist with CR’s other foundational principles. For example,\\u202fMatthew 5:4\\u202fdoes not teach that one must “earnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to Him, and that He has the power to help me recover”.11John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 9 Instead, Jesus teaches that true believers are characterized as those who are shattered and sorrowful for having sinned against God (“Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted”).\\u202fMatthew 5:8\\u202fdoes not teach that, to recover, I must “[o]penly examine and confess my faults to myself, to God, and to someone I trust”.12John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 9 The verse teaches nothing about addiction recovery nor confessing faults to myself. Rather, Jesus is teaching that true believers are characterized by a measure of spiritual and moral purity even at the level of the will and worship. And, notwithstanding the GNT,\\u202fMatthew 5:6\\u202fdoes not say, “Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires,” but, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.” Thus, in addition to an imposed meaning on the text, CR often uses inadequate translations of Scripture.\\xa0\\nSo, many of the principles upon which CR rests and from which the curriculum is expounded are constructed from a misuse of Scripture and erroneous hermeneutics. Consequently, if CR intends to find a protocol for recovery, they will need to look somewhere other than the Beatitudes and the Sermon on the Mount.\\xa0\\nCR errs elsewhere in its use of Scripture. Often words taken from the realm of psychology are used in place of God’s word to describe sin. For example, terms such as “co-dependent,” “addiction,” and “abusing”13John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 167 of substances are not found in Scripture. One reason is because those terms are not God’s way of describing those behaviors.\\xa0\\nInstead, Scripture describes addictions in terms of sinful enslavement to one’s lusts and pleasures and lovers of pleasure (e.g.\\u202fRom. 6:12-13,\\u202fEph. 2:3,\\u202f2 Tim. 3:4). One who is addicted to, or practices the abuse of, alcohol, for example, is best referred to as a drunkard or drunkenness (e.g.\\u202f1 Cor. 6:10,\\u202fGal. 5:21). God made no mistakes in the inspiration of his word (cf.\\u202fProv. 30:5-6,\\u202f2 Tim. 3:16-17). Therefore, it is best for us to use his Spirit-given terms when describing all things, whether sins or blessings.\\xa0\\nCR misuses Scripture in its teaching of forgiveness. For example, the assertion is made that since we have been forgiven by God, we must forgive ourselves.14John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 193\\u202fMatthew 22:39\\u202f(“You shall love your neighbor as yourself”) is used to support the assertion. The question is posed, “Now, how can you love or forgive your neighbor, if you can’t love or forgive yourself?”.15John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 193 Jesus is not implying, much less teaching, self-love or self-forgiveness there. On the contrary, much of our sinfulness is excessive self-love. The idea is not that self-love and self-forgiveness is the gate to love others, but to love others as much as we effortlessly do ourselves.\\xa0\\nAdditionally, the idea of forgiving oneself is an unbiblical idea not found in Scripture, thus one that Christians must reject. Forgiveness is a transaction between parties when the offended releases the offender from an infraction. While we can sin against other people, all our sin is against the One to whom we are culpable; God. Thus, forgiveness is needed from God, not ourselves.\\xa0\\nThough claiming to be biblically based, many of CR’s teachings are constructed from a misuse of Scripture and an erroneous hermeneutic. Consequently, participants are not shepherded in an accurate handling of God’s word. One likely objection may be,\\u202f“So many people have been helped by CR. How can one criticize something that works so well?” We do not doubt that people have received help from CR in curbing addictions. In some measure, that is a good thing. However, the objection hinges on the definition of “works well” and “people being helped.” Further, should something that misinterprets God’s word and errs theologically be so justified?\\xa0\\n\\nMuch of CR’s theology clashes with sound Christian theology.\\xa0\\n\\nSeveral examples will be examined here.\\xa0\\nGod\\xa0\\nCR generally teaches a view of God lower than that of Scripture. For example, according to CR, God seems to not be sovereign over the hurt we experience in our lives. “You need to understand and believe that the harm others did to you was from their free will. It was their choice, not God’s. It was\\u202fnot\\u202fGod’s will”.16John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 192 Certainly,\\u202fthose who hurt others\\u202fcertainly make an active choice to do so, for which they are culpable. And sin against others is not God’s prescribed will. However, the lack of clarity with respect to God’s decretive will is troubling. Though being sinned against can be painful, we must say with Scripture, “In the day of prosperity be happy, but in the day of adversity consider—God has made the one as well as the other” (Eccles. 7:14). CR lacks clarity here, while failing to teach that we can trust the love and wisdom of God who is sovereign over all of our battles.\\xa0\\nCR teaches that God is an unsovereign bystander in our salvation. Man’s salvation is up to his own\\u202fwillpower. The sinner chooses God.17John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 11-13, 85, 90, 105-106, 167) “He loved us so much that He gave us a free will”.18John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 192 This clashes with Scripture, which teaches the sovereign grace of God in sinners’ salvation (e.g.\\u202fJohn 3:3-8,\\u202f6:44;\\u202fRom. 8:29-30,\\u202f9:15-16;\\u202fEph. 1:4-5).\\xa0\\nAdditionally, CR teaches that God must be forgiven by the addict. Baker writes, “On your list of ‘others to forgive,’ you might have forgotten about someone you may need to forgive; God. Yes, you heard me right. God”.19John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 192 No such thing can be found anywhere in Scripture. Now, CR teaches that God cannot and does not sin. However, elsewhere, forgiveness is described as letting go and that “forgiving your enemy sets you one above him”.20John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 192 So, where does forgiving God place us in relation to him? Such teaching suggests that God is somehow accountable to man, thus dethroning him\\u202ffrom his glorious position of Sovereign Lord and King (cf.\\u202fPs. 93:1-2).\\xa0\\nFinally, in an inappropriate AA parallel, CR repeatedly refers to Christ as the sinner’s “Higher Power.” While it is a good start to mention him as the “only Higher Power”21John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 43, the terminology does not go far enough in capturing Scripture’s teaching on Christ. Worse, the phrase too closely parallels AA’s reference to a subjective god of man’s making. Christ is not a power that is higher, but the omnipotent, uncreated, eternally existing I AM, God, Creator, and sustainer of all things who. Incredibly, he loved sinners, demonstrated by absorbing the righteous anger of God due them (John 1:1-3,\\u202f8:58;\\u202fCol. 1:16-17;\\u202fHeb. 1:3;\\u202f1 John 4:10).\\xa0\\nEven more, CR’s view of Christ is parochial: far more than the “Higher Power” who helps me in my recovery, he is the King of kings whom I am to worship (Phil. 2:10) and the only Savior through whom man can be acceptable before holy God (John 14:6,\\u202f1 Tim. 2:5-6). Yet, in the brief references to Christ now and then, CR does not speak of him in these terms.\\xa0\\nHumanity and the Problem\\xa0\\nIn CR, man is reduced to an addicted creature with “hurts, hang-ups, and habits.” However, Scripture teaches that every person is a worshipping creature, made in the image of God for the glory of God. In CR, what defines man is his addictions and culpability to his self-actualization. In Scripture, what defines man is his image bearing and culpability to God (Gen. 1:26-27).\\nCR teaches that humanity is not entirely dead in sin, but capable, by his will, of choosing God in salvation (11-13, 85, 90, 105-6, 167, 192). Humanity’s problems are often described as low self-esteem, low self-love, and the need for self-forgiveness (167-8). For example, Baker writes that the root of his enslavement to alcohol was low self-esteem22John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 14 and a “lack of positive self-image”.23John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 167 This lack of self-esteem is taught to be the root of all sin from which other negative behaviors arise.24John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 167 Such lack of positive self-image is what causes an individual to engage in addictive behaviors. Therefore, CR teaches that humanity’s deepest problem from which all sin springs is self-image and self-esteem.\\xa0\\nThe problems with CR’s understanding of man and his problems are numerous. First, man is fundamentally an image-bearer of God, created to worship him (Gen. 1:26-27,\\u202fIsa. 43:7). However, all humanity since the Fall of Adam and Eve are conceived with a sinful nature, which is incessantly hostile towards the true God (Rom. 3:10-18). Consequently, with the full capacity and desire to worship remaining, our hearts (the seat of our will) rebelliously cling to and crave created things in worship over and above the Creator (Rom. 1:18-23). The product is as bad as it gets: man is both relentlessly religious and entirely sinful. Thus, in our natural state, we are relentless idolaters, in constant violation of our great obligation, privilege, and purpose to worship God with the full capacity of our hearts. To be sure, it is not simply the drunkard or drug user (as I once was) who are enslaved to the created things of this world. All humanity are idolaters: motivated by love for self and enmity towards God, we are rebelliously enslaved to give loyalty to anything except God. Consequently, some worship alcohol and its effects; others, food; still others, things like body image, sex, money, reputation, kids’ performances, comfort, exercise, approval, and moral performance.\\xa0\\nHowever, underneath all idolatry is not low self-love, but the contrary: we worship idols out of an extreme devotion to self. Thus, self-esteem is not the answer. As somewhat of a case study to prove the point, God has recorded for us a tragic-comical moment in history, displaying the product of man’s high self-esteem. At the Tower of Babel, man’s self-esteem drove him to build praise for himself by attempting to construct a tower so high that, perhaps, he could not only avoid another flood, but look God in the eye to self-cure\\u202fhis proud inferiority complex (cf.\\u202fGen. 11:4). We know how that ended.\\xa0\\nAt no time does God’s word instruct us to better love ourselves. In fact, quite the opposite. Paul warns Timothy that one symptom of increasingly unchecked human depravity is that “men will be lovers of self” (2 Tim. 3:2).\\u202fOur problem is not that we are poor self-lovers with “hurts, hang-ups, and habits that didn’t work”25John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 74, but being lords of self, we feed ourselves with whatever idol will soothe, exalt, please, praise, comfort, venerate, and prefer self. Man is naturally a colossal lover of self, adoring and worshiping himself. Sons of Adam naturally loathe and resent any threat to his self-rule and self-exaltation.\\xa0\\nContrary to CR’s teaching, character defects are the consequence of our sinful self-devotion (Prov. 4:23,\\u202fJer. 17:9,\\u202fMark 7:14-23,\\u202fGal. 5:19-21,\\u202fJames 1:14-15). We are dead to God, unwilling and unable to please him in this state (Eph. 2:1-3). Without ever having to be taught or conditioned, every human being is born in extraordinary religious devotion to the anti-Luke 10:27-28, loving the lord himself, with all his heart, and all his soul, and all his strength, and all his mind, and hating his neighbor as much as he loves himself.\\xa0\\nTherefore, man is in gross violation of God’s good and holy moral requirements (Rom. 3:23). Our due punishment corresponds to the greatness of the One whom he has violated. As such, we\\u202fdeserve to endure the righteous wrath of God for eternity (2 Thess. 1:8-9,\\u202fRev. 20:11-15). A boost in self-esteem will only compound the problem. We\\u202fmay feel better, but we\\u202fremain incessant self-worshipers, facing eternity in hell. Tragically, CR omits virtually all of these truths on the nature and standing of humanity, thus, harming its participants and setting itself up for an anemic gospel.\\xa0\\nSalvation\\xa0\\nIn CR, salvation is recovery from addictive behavior. CR’s process of salvation could be captured as follows: man is an addicted being beset with hurts, hang-ups, and habits. Through CR, he learns to manage his hurts, hang-ups, and habits through forgiving God, others, and himself, belief in the Higher Power, Jesus Christ, and improved self-love and self-esteem. The curbing of the addictions and enthusiastic involvement in CR demonstrates his healing. He continues involvement in CR, as a “believer who struggles with .”\\xa0\\nWhen CR describes the event of salvation, man is in charge as he chooses God. God must be permitted to act26John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 166, 170. The word repentance is mentioned, being described as taking God’s point of view on our lives over our own, while turning away from our sins and turning towards God.27John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 107 This was one of the high points of the book. However, the event of salvation can be triggered by the sinner praying a formulaic prayer to accept Christ.\\xa0\\nIn all the testimonies in the book, few, if any, contained the true gospel. They go back to the moment in time they prayed a prayer, walked an aisle, sat in CR for the first time, or experienced healing from addiction. CR’s gospel is addiction recovery.\\xa0The problems here are significant. Our needs are more serious than CR teaches.\\xa0\\nFirst, our need is not to recover from an addiction but to be forgiven our infinite sin debt (Rom. 4:7-8). God’s law brings focus to our condemnation before God (Rom. 3:19-20). Our only hope is that he might respond to our cry of mercy by forgiving our infinite debt to remove the hell we deserve.\\xa0\\nSecond, our need is reconciliation to God (Isa. 59:2). By nature, and deed, we are his sworn enemies (Rom. 5:10). In our incessant idolatry, we are in perpetual rebellion against him. To remain there would mean eternal hell.\\xa0\\nThird, our need is a righteousness with which we can stand acceptable to our Creator, not a few principles to assist with addictions (Phil. 3:9). Man’s problem of the ages is not addictions but a woefully inadequate righteousness before God.\\xa0\\nFourth, our need is an entire change of nature (John 3:3,\\u202f5). More than recovery from poor behavior, we are in desperate need of a new heart that worships Christ, not cravings (2 Cor. 5:17). Since our problem stems from worship, we need to be repaired at that deepest level so as to be willing and able to please God.\\xa0\\nFifth, man’s need is not to love himself, but loathe himself. Christ presented self-hate as necessary for following him (Luke 14:26, cf.\\u202f2 Cor. 7:10-11). In fact, in a passage which describes the future salvation of Israel, God describes the consequence of receiving his grace of regeneration by the Holy Spirit as follows: “…you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves in our own sight for your iniquities and your abominations” (Ezek. 36:31). So, a recovery to spiritual health (if we might put it in such terms) will not look like greater self-love, but self-loathing. By nature, we so crave our own lordship, that it takes nothing less than the power of Almighty God in regeneration to pry our self-venerating claws off the throne of our hearts and place himself there.\\xa0\\nOf course, the problem with these needs is that we are incapable of providing them for ourselves. If God does not act, we are hopelessly lost. We may be able to rotate idols to appear more socially acceptable, but we would remain condemned idolaters before God, headed for a miserable eternity. CR attempts to present a system of salvation-recovery, while, tragically, failing to address these greatest of man’s needs. A possible consequence of self-esteem theology is he externally assures himself with Bible verses and Christian principles but remains an incessant self-worshiper under the banner of Christianity. He remains his own lord but has recruited an unbiblical Jesus to assist in his self-centered agenda.\\xa0\\nUnlike CR’s teaching, it is with self-denial, not self-love, that we come to the Lord Jesus Christ in repentance, and not for mere behavioral recovery, but reconciliation to God (Luke 9:23). Salvation is more than belief in Jesus for addiction therapy. Christ, being fully God, stepped out of heaven, became a man, and lived a perfect life in full obedience in thought, word, and deed, to the requirements of God’s law (Gal. 4:4-5). At no time was he sinfully enslaved to idols. Instead, he worshiped God perfectly (Heb. 4:15). Motivated by his own mercy, he willingly went to the cross where he suffered and died, bowing under the righteous wrath of God due us, to eliminate our condemnation (John 10:17-18;\\u202f1 John 4:10;\\u202f1 Pet. 2:24). He was then raised for our justification and ascended to heaven as exalted Lord (Rom. 4:25,\\u202fHeb. 12:2). Man is called then to repent of his sin and surrender to Christ as Lord (Acts 17:30-31). By faith in Christ, God counts the penalty for all our sin to have been served in the death of Christ, while simultaneously counting us righteous in Christ, to be at peace with him (Rom. 5:1,\\u202f2 Cor. 5:21).\\xa0\\nContrary to CR’s teaching, salvation occurs, not by man’s permission, but God’s sovereign act of grace on the dead sinner (John 6:44,\\u202f65). By his mercy, he causes the supernatural work of regeneration by the Holy Spirit, in which a new nature is given (John 3:3-7,\\u202fTitus 3:5). It is instantaneous and accomplished by the power of the Spirit through the instrumentality of the word of God (John 5:24), when the repentant sinner, as enabled by the Spirit, responds in faith to the gospel (Eph. 1:13-14). That is the good news of God’s grace in Christ, which meets humanity’s greatest need.\\xa0\\nThe Risk of Promoting False Assurance\\xa0\\nBut CR risks promoting false assurance of salvation. A few pages into the CR Leader’s Guide, an unbiblical view of salvation is purported in the author’s testimony. He writes, “I asked Christ into my heart at age thirteen”28John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 14, then describes nearly two decades of no fruit bearing. However, the writer asserts, “I knew that if I died, I was saved, but my Christianity was not reflected in my lifestyle, business practices, and priorities”.29John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 15\\nThough perhaps unintentionally, this immediately sets the stage in CR for a view of salvation that does not square with Scripture. Jesus taught, “Every branch in Me that does no bear fruit, He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit…I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing” (John 15:2,\\u202f5). “The one who says, ‘I have come to know Him,’ and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him” (1 John 2:4). Contrary to the author’s testimony, Scripture gives no assurance to individuals who persist in a life without fruit bearing (cf.\\u202fEph. 2:10,\\u202f1 John 2:3-6).\\xa0\\nAdditional false assurance is risked with addiction-recovery akin to salvation in CR. With little to no teaching on man’s incessant idolatry and violation of God’s holy law, the consequent punishment of hell, and the need for justification, CR endangers its participants. If a CR participant says a prayer, affirms belief in Jesus, and experiences behavioral improvement, assurance is given. However, it’s possible to have swept the soul clean, leaving it unoccupied by the Spirit (Luke 11:24-26).\\xa0\\nSanctification\\xa0\\nCR teaches that the path to change is to “let go and let God”.30John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 17, 95, 166 By embracing the eight foundation principles, change is expected to occur (142). Growth and lasting change seem to be centered on perpetual CR attendance. Cessation of attendance and working through the 8 Principles and 12 Steps is not suggested.31John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 167\\nScripture offers a more comprehensive, promising transformation in the process of sanctification (Rom. 8:29-30). God’s work is not limited to perpetual addiction recovery but conforming the whole soul into Christlikeness (2 Cor. 3:18). And, contrary to CR, enslavements no longer affix to the identity of God’s children. Such things\\u202fwere\\u202fwe (1 Cor. 6:11). But, by the regenerating and sanctifying work of the Spirit, we are not merely getting help with hurts, hang-ups, and habits, but putting our entire sin nature to death (Rom. 8:13-14,\\u202fCol. 3:5). Through regular immersion in the means of grace (e.g. biblical preaching, Scripture reading, prayer, repentance, one anothers), the Spirit ministers transforming love to the soul. However, the means of grace are not mentioned in CR. Instead, the CR program is the means of grace. But, with incorrect interpretations of Scripture and erroneous theology, both salvation and sanctification are hindered.\\xa0\\nThe Church\\xa0\\nIn psychology’s teaching, deep-seated problems can be solved only by the professional counselor’s therapy. In AA, enslavement is treated through perpetual AA involvement. CR parallels both, in that the enslavement is treated through perpetual recovery in the CR system of therapy.\\xa0\\nParticipants are functionally taught to put faith in the CR system. Christ is mentioned as the “Higher Power,” but only in name. Little is said about his attributes, deity, righteousness, and sin-bearing work. Instead, CR participants are, perhaps inadvertently, conditioned to depend on the packaged methods and ideas of the program. Then, since individuals are addicts in perpetual recovery, they cannot survive apart from the CR system. Thus, CR replaces Christ’s institution, the church.\\xa0\\nFurthermore, the goal is to feel “safe at Celebrate Recovery”.32John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 73 I am guessing that CR’s creators are not attempting to replace Christ’s church, but, with this approach, they risk doing so. It’s as if CR says, “Well, for those battling with addictions, Christ’s church is not quite adequate for you. You need something more. What you need is what we have created; Celebrate Recovery.” Shepherding is through perpetual CR attendance (29, 37, 59, 167-8). One’s choice of a local church is irrelevant.33John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 59, 167-8 While attending a church is mentioned as a good idea, it is not promoted as necessary34John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 242. Baker writes, “If you aren’t ready to get involved in your church, that’s your decision”.35John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 146 So, CR participants need not come under the shepherding and accountability of biblically qualified elders for God’s best kind of care. Instead, they may perpetually remain in CR and assured that all is well. Even so, CR claims that “[Jesus] is the rock, the foundation, of the Celebrate Recovery program”.36John Baker,\\u202fCelebrate Recovery Leader’s Guide, 29\\nConsequently, it cannot be concluded that Christ is the head or foundation of CR. As a program which misuses Scripture, whose theology is erroneous, and replaces the church, it brings itself under another head.\\xa0\\nHowever, if Christ is a sufficient God, then that one organism which he builds must also be the sufficient organism to shepherd broken and enslaved people. Christ taught that he builds and blesses one institution; the church (Matt. 16:18). CR, however, suggests that one can be devoted to Christ yet detached from the church. We would be hard pressed to suggest saving union with Christ while indifferent union with his Bride (Eph. 5:25-27,\\u202fRev. 19:7), Body (Eph. 1:22-23), and flock (John 21:15-17). The individual\\u202fwith indifferent involvement in the local church should probably not be encouraged to be a better Christian, but evangelized to become one.\\xa0\\nThose in CR who are not actively involved (or encouraged to be) in a sound, New Testament local church, are deprived of God’s kind of care. They risk missing out on the joy, security, and privilege of relationship with and submission to biblically qualified elders (Heb. 13:17,\\u202f1 Pet. 5:2-3). They miss out on frequent, meaty feeding through expository preaching (1 Tim. 4:13,\\u202f2 Tim. 4:2). They miss out on sanctification and cultivating their Spirit gifts in the context of people much different than them in the body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:7,\\u202f12).\\xa0\\nFinally, we might ask, “Was there a people in biblical times who struggled with various enslavements to whom writers of Scripture ministered? If so, what did they do without CR?” Take Corinth for example. From Paul’s writings, we know people were enslaved to things like alcohol, drugs, stealing, homosexual and heterosexual sin, and other destructive behaviors (cf.\\u202f1 Cor. 6:9-11). What was the solution? Create a special program? Christ’s local church with all her normal, often-unexciting means of grace sufficed. Go to church. Sit under Christ-crucified preaching and teaching. Get shepherded by elders. Repent of sin. Read Scripture. Take communion. Love people. Practice the one-another commandments. Pray. Repeat. For Paul, that was enough. Addictions are not a special set of sins requiring something more than Christ’s church.\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\nWhen it comes to packaging an organized program, CR has done a fantastic job. Potential participants and leaders have everything they need to jump in. The program is well-structured, creative, and contains an incredible amount of ingenious acronyms in each lesson. CR’s creators certainly have put much work and thought into the program.\\xa0\\nHowever, as far as a Christ-centered, biblically based program, CR falls significantly short. Though claiming to be biblically based, its teachings are often constructed from a misuse of Scripture and an erroneous hermeneutic. Though claiming to be Christian based, its theology often clashes with sound Christian theology. Therefore, a Christian church looking to shepherd people struggling with enslaving sins should rethink using Celebrate Recovery.\\xa0\\nSuperior Alternatives to Celebrate Recovery\\xa0\\nThose who have turned to CR in attempt to bring Christ’s love to souls ought to be commended for their desire to care. The church must do something to minister to such needs. However, there are several superior alternatives.\\xa0\\nFirst, church leaders ought to equip themselves and members to counsel people biblically. No substitution exists for unrushed, rigorous training in how to accurately handle and minister the Scriptures (2 Tim. 2:15). It is the church’s high, exalted calling from her Lord to give herself fully to raising up mature men and women, competent in God’s word (2 Tim. 2:2). No shortcuts exist here, nor should they be sought (1 Tim. 5:22).\\xa0\\nChurches can seek outside help for such training, for example, from the\\u202fAssociation of Certified Biblical Counselors. Once a leader or two are certified, then they can train others in the church and even work towards becoming an ACBC-certified training center. Churches will not be able to construct something as quick as a CR program. But that is not a bad thing. The goal is not to get something going that appears to work, but that is biblical.\\xa0\\nSecond, several resources exist as biblical alternatives to CR. For example, the book,\\u202fAddictions: A Banquet in the Grave, by Ed Welch, is a must read.

      "{'title': 'Freedom That Lasts', 'subtitle': 'Truth In Love 431', 'author': 'Ben Marshall  Dale Johnson', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'What is the Freedom that Lasts ministry about?', 'body': 'Dale Johnson:\\xa0This week on the podcast, we have with us Dr. Ben Marshall. He and his wife have been married for 24 years, they have eight children ranging from age 21 all the way down to 11 months. He spent the last 25 years in Washington State doing pastoral work, 10 years as a youth pastor, with 15 years as a counseling pastor. He received his undergraduate in Psychology at St. Martin’s University, has an MABC from The Master’s University and his Doctor of Educational Ministry in Biblical Counseling at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was certified with ACBC in 2008, became a fellow with us in 2020, and he now is the executive director for Freedom that Lasts. A ministry which equips churches to welcome, evangelize, and biblically counsel the hurting and addicted to grow in Christlikeness and wisdom in living life. And so Ben, that’s actually what I want to talk to you about today is the ministry Freedom that Lasts. So, welcome to the podcast. Thanks for taking time and talking to us about the ministry.\\nBen Marshall: For sure, thanks for having me.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0So let’s start there, what is “Freedom that Lasts”? I mean, I think for many people, they may not know about this ministry. And so, I want to give you an opportunity to introduce lots of people to Freedom that Lasts.\\xa0\\nBen Marshall: Yeah, so Freedom that Lasts is a ministry that is aimed at helping those who are struggling with addiction or hurting. So, we’ve got both categories to cover their suffering and sin. The addiction, the material absolutely spans that spectrum, and it started with a guy by the name of Jim Berg. He was having some contractors do some work in his house and he was just faithfully sharing the Gospel with each one of those guys who happen to be there and one guy in particular responded to the Gospel, and then said, “I need help. I’m struggling with drugs.” And so that started a relationship that went beyond what Jim could do in his home. Meaning this, it went beyond three months, the work started in the summer when Jim was off, he wasn’t teaching. And so he was looking at the schedule and he got to start teaching again. So, it went beyond that time span, but it also went beyond what they could house in their house. So they moved to the church and then things just kept progressing from there and other churches started hearing about what he was doing. So he formalized some of that stuff in, not some of it, he formalized all of it into an addiction or an adult addiction curriculum, a teen addiction curriculum, and even a prison or an institutional curriculum.\\nSo really all of those now are represented under the Freedom that Lasts banner. There’s three books for adults, three books for teens and then two books for those who are in some kind of an institution. So the way that it works, there are FTL chapters and they’re kind of all across the country, even as I’m talking to you, I’m looking at the map on my wall and some see it flags popping up all over the place which is great, but those chapters then they meet throughout the week, a lot of them meet on Friday night, that goes all the way back to the beginning when Jim started working with the one contractor. He said, “I really need you to do this on Friday night because I get paid, I have a pocket full of cash and a whole weekend to use it.” So Jim agreed, and that’s just kind of stayed with it. So, a lot of chapters do meet on Friday. Some of them, that’s not a mandate, though.\\nThen there’s three basic components to every Freedom that Lasts night. There is a component where you’re just, some people might call it a testimony time, but what has God been up to in your life? And it’s not allowed to be negative. So listen, this is where I struggled all week. I thought for sure when I started visiting different\\xa0Freedom that Lasts chapters there would be some dead time, that is not the case at all. As soon as that microphone starts being passed around, people are talking about what God has been up to and how faithful He has been, and then that transitions into prayer request time. Pray out loud for everybody and then moves into small group time or care group time, and that’s where the book material is unpacked. It doesn’t matter where somebody is at and which book they’re in, it’s all self-paced. That’s what makes this shine from my perspective, having run groups before there was always this issue. If you have a new person coming in, do we slow the group down to catch them up, or do we just let him flounder around and hope that they catch up all on their own? But with this being self-paced, literally, everybody in each care group is at a different spot in the book, so just fits with the program. So that’s the care group time and then it ends with a teaching time, and so, whether that’s Jim Berg teaching or Ben Marshall or whoever, and what we’ve done as a ministry is we have provided all of those videos to be downloaded. So, there’s a small church and they don’t have somebody who can teach or feels comfortable teaching whatever, there’s a plug-and-play option. They can download a video and that can be there during their teaching time, but those three components are what make up a freedom that last meeting and then some churches end with fellowship and food, but not every church does that. So that’s kind of Freedom that Lasts in a nutshell. I know, I just spent through that bag kind of shotgun that out. But that’s really what we’re doing. I’m getting more and more requests and sometimes it’s through kind of direct marketing, Facebook, those kinds of things, but a lot of it’s coming through word of mouth. So, I was on the phone two weeks ago with the church up in Canada. And that spawned another email interaction with another church kind of right down the street. We just brought out a church in Colorado, another one in Pennsylvania, it’s just popping up all over the place and churches are really looking for some help in this area, some structure to it. And because there’s no shortage of addicts.\\nDale Johnson: That’s very true and I want to ask that question, that’ll be the last question I ask you today about a church being able to pursue Freedom that Lasts. But before we go there, and where you can get some basic instruction at the end, I want to talk a little bit about Freedom that Lasts and how it differs from a 12-step program. And the reason I want to ask that is because you know what people in our culture are most familiar with is a 12-step program, whether that be the biblical sort of version. You know, a lot of people are familiar with Celebrate Recovery or if we’re looking at AA or something like that. And so that’s sort of what people are familiar with. So, Ben, help us to understand a little bit about how Freedom that Lasts is different from those 12 steps.\\xa0\\nBen Marshall: Yeah, before I hop in there, I do think the one very attractive component to whether it’s a CR, or a 12-step, or, you know, whatever is I can go to this group and these people understand almost instinctively what I’m struggling with. I don’t have to worry about how are they going to view me or this, that popped out to me 15 years ago when I had to take over, it was called for men only. It was for men who were struggling with sexual sin and they were guys, by the time I handed that group off, we had about 50 guys and about half of them came from our church and half came from other churches. And they said our church won’t touch this with a 10-foot pole. It’s so nice to be able to come into a room and not feel condemned, not feel like, you know, I should have a big p on my chest for, you know, pervert or whatever. So I think the one thing that really makes a lot of these groups shine is, I can go and know, I’m in a group here that wants me to grow.\\nSo now, what about Freedom that Lasts? How is that different? Our aim isn’t just sobriety and I want to underline and highlight bold “just.” We absolutely want people to stop the sin that they’re wrapped up in and I use that word sobriety because that’s a very common terminology, but if it’s a gambler, we want them to stop gambling. If there’s a drinker, we want them to stop drinking, you can pick the individual sin. We want them to stop doing that, but our goal is Christlikeness. And so, you can have a dry drunk, somebody who doesn’t drink alcohol at all but he’s angrier, you know, and scarier than anybody people know. And so, matter of fact, I’ve talked with people who said, I just wish so-and-so would start drinking again, because at least and then they fill in what was better about him when he was drinking than how he is now.\\nSo we’re really shooting for Christlikeness and we absolutely are sold out that that happens through Scripture and Scripture alone. So with one, if somebody is faithful through the whole thing, they will have memorized 83 different Scriptures, and it’s my firm conviction that it’s the memorization of Scripture that the Holy Spirit uses them to transform the mind. And so, then if somebody stops doing something and I don’t know about you, but as I’m working with counselees, and we talked about, okay, what do you need to stop doing, boom. It’s just right there. They know what they need to stop doing and what do you need to start doing and there is like crickets there’s tumbleweed. That doesn’t necessarily, you know, just pop into their mind. And it’s the same thing with people at Freedom that Lasts, we need to help them figure out what to put on. Well, Scripture when it’s clearly unpacked, it tells us exactly what we need to be putting on in order to be transformed more into the image of Jesus. So that’s what we’re shooting for. I think that the hesitancy that I’m hearing from pastors is yeah, but will that be attractive to, you know, those who are coming right off the street or those who have been in the drug war? And my whole thing is the ones I’m familiar with who are at the end of their rope, they’ve hit rock bottom, whatever you want to call it. They’re already, people are already looking at me in a horrible light. I’m going to come in here, you’re promising something, and I’m going to ride on your promise for a little while. And let’s see what happens. And those are the testimonies that we’re hearing week after week. This is what God did in my life as I was faithful to obey His Word. And you know, my son who I haven’t talked to in 15 years called me out of the blue. Well, we know, it wasn’t just out of the blue, God is sovereignly working and orchestrating things, but from their perspective, it’s out of the blue and so they’re just they’re watching as I’m faithful to be obedient to Scripture both in the putting off and the putting on, as my mind is being transformed I am becoming a whole new person.\\nThat from my perspective, that’s the amazing part. And what I have found is this is one of the easiest ways to introduce people into that front-row seat of biblical counseling, where they might be a little bit too intimidated. Like I don’t think I could sit there by myself in a room and know where to go, what to do, all those kinds of things. I just say, great, you don’t have to be by yourself. You’re in a team with you in a Freedom that Lasts group, and you can watch these things happen without the pressure of just being by yourself. I’ve often told supervisees or students, biblical counseling often feels like wrestling. That’s what I did in high school and, you know, you’re on a team. But when you’re out on the mat, it’s just you and that other person, it sure doesn’t feel like a team. So, but with the Freedom that Lasts the group approach, you definitely feel like you’re on a team. I think that is what makes us different is the Scriptural approach and the sanctification approach.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now I want to talk about that. We mentioned the 12-step; I want to talk about the way that Freedom that Lasts differs from Celebrate Recovery. I mean, they would use passages of Scripture in that sort of thing, so that would be a little bit closer to what we’re talking about here with Freedom that Lasts. Talk\\xa0about how those two things are different. CR’s approach and FTL’s approach.\\xa0\\nBen Marshall: So without being able to sit down and just kind of compare side-by-side, as I read CR material. Here’s a thought. Here’s some Scripture that seems to align with that thought. And as opposed to here’s Scripture, I mean that all of book one the only thing that we’re doing is unpacking, second Peter chapter 1 verses 5 to 7. Each one of those categories, saving faith and virtue and knowledge. We’re just unpacking each one of those in the order that Peter gave them in the order that God wanted us to have those. And then we’re practically applying that as opposed to a much more pragmatic approach, which is, here’s our idea, let’s go to Scripture and find that idea in Scripture and kind of staple it to that. That’s my terminology as far as stapling Scripture. So, you know, the question is where did that idea originate in the first place? Did it originate in Scripture or did it originate somewhere else? And I’m going to Scripture to try and prove that, so it’s what I would call proof texting and most of CR is going to proof text in what they’re doing. Now, some of those things are going to line up. So as I’ve talked with other people they are like, well, what about this? What about this, okay, I can’t argue that but what I can argue is the rhythm of what you’re doing is here’s an idea, most of it’s coming from 12-step material, let’s find in Scripture something that seems to match up with that and then claim we’re pulling this out of Scripture and that seems to be backward from a faithful hermeneutic, so…\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, so I mean I would add to that just the paradigm that a person sees a problem matters most, so if they’re approaching it from, you know, the paradigm is sort of a 12-step or a principle approach, then that paradigm is going to change the way a person sees themself. And now the means of change is okay the Bible is helpful but it’s not central. The Holy Spirit can be helpful to sort of nudge me across the line, but he’s not like necessary and central. To me that becomes problematic because biblically the way we define a problem helps us to understand what we’re seeking for as a solution, and people might say, well, Celebrate Recovery uses the Scripture. Well, it’s one thing to have the right end or the goal, right, but another thing to have the means to get to that goal so they have a goal of sobriety. Well, sobriety that’s an okay goal, but it’s really short-sighted because you can wash the outside of a cup and if you’re not watching the inside of the cup, what you’re getting out is not godliness. You’re actually you know, just conforming the outside, so we can say we have a similar goal of you know wanting to exhaust Scripture or wanting a person to not be drunk or not be captivated by this whatever they were addicted to, and you justify the means and it becomes a problem where now we can use a 12-step program to accomplish this, and that that’s an issue. We need to have a proper goal and then means that come out of Scripture to help us to achieve that goal where we see not just the external value of the Bible, but it’s necessity to accomplish this work in the depths of the human heart over wrestling passions and desires that have to have this person captivated and these are not things that we can do with our human wisdom. We can’t overturn or overrule those issues in a person’s heart.\\nAnd so, that’s what we’re talking about as the distinction here that I think is so helpful and the focus of Freedom that Lasts. I think that that helps to push, you know, an addict in a direction that is redeeming and helpful and we don’t talk about in terms of recovery, but renewal like that a person is absolutely renewed in their heart, in their mind, and then it flushes out in their attitudes, and behaviors all the way around. And so I think that’s that’s really helpful. Talk for just a second, Ben, I know Freedom that Lasts, it is definitely one of those ministries where you guys are put together, useful things, helpful things in the church, but there’s some other folks, as well. Will you talk a little bit about, you know, some of those other ministries as well?\\nBen Marshall: Yes, one of the overarching ministries is The Addiction Connection. Mark Shaw is at the top of that, and he has “Be Transformed Next Steps” curriculum, I believe it’s 18 months long. So very thorough. I think that is a huge alternative. I got commissioned with The Addiction Connection just a few months ago. So that is definitely a like-minded ministry. I’m speaking at their annual conference in August, so I would definitely encourage people to look at that. I have talked to other people who said, you know, that it’s meant to be used in a variety of different settings and so it might not be as structured as a Freedom that Lasts group, but the material that’s there is still outstanding and so, I would just say to anybody who’s listening, if you come across any kind of material run through The Addiction Connection, send the name of the ministry, the name of the book, there is a good chance that ministry has had interaction, they know that material well and they could give you good feedback on, you know, is this approach to addiction a Biblical approach or is it more of an integrated or even just purely secular approach? Because whenever you’re talking 12-step, there’s always going to be a spiritual component. And so, if a pastor is just looking for something spiritual, they’re going to find it in almost every single 12-step program, so they need to change their, what they’re hunting for away from spiritual to biblical, and then kind of referencing what you just mentioned. There’s a difference between referencing Scripture and ministering Scripture, and so, what they’re looking for is some kind of an addiction approach that is ministering Scripture, not just referencing it.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah. And that’s a huge distinction, and I’ll echo exactly what you said, Mark has been doing this a long time and really appreciate that brother and he was actually very influential and helpful for us at ACBC to do our specialization in addiction, our training that we do for our certified members. The specialization that one could obtain, Mark was very helpful and influential in that. Now, burning question that I’m sure or maybe a couple of questions that our listeners may still have about Freedom that Lasts, and how does a church participate with\\xa0Freedom that Lasts, how do they start to utilize your curriculum? How do they start to implement this there? How do they train some of their leaders? All of those things that, man, I get excited when I think about a church that can Implement some of the things you’re describing it becomes very missional to the most downtrodden in their community and how does the church accomplish that type of work with something like Freedom that Lasts?\\xa0\\nBen Marshall: Yeah, the easiest ways is to get in touch with me. They can go to Freedomthatlasts.com, and on the webpage there, there is a link where it will send me an email automatically and I will get right back in touch with them and we can set up a Zoom link for us to talk and if it’s a pastor we can talk, if it’s a lay member, we can talk. They want to invite, I mean there’s all kinds of different ways that we can go about connecting people to what we’re doing. I do love what you just said about being missional, having just moved to the Greenville area. I’ve never had to try and find a church before in my life. I’ve always been employed at the churches that I went to, but we landed on one in an area of Greenville that is a little bit on the economically depressed side of things, a little bit more transient, but we landed there because their heartbeat is for that community and we’re taking advantage of the Freedom that Lasts, my connection there to equip our people and then to help minister to our community. And our goal is we want to see men and women come to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior as well as being changed in this life, not just into the next.\\nSo, I’m excited to see how this rolls out. We had our first meeting just yesterday with 10 people and our goal is to have this thing fully launched by the end of August. So, if people are listening to this and like, how long does it take to get something up and going? It could be relatively short, but I think the wise approach is get people onboard familiar with what’s going on. Do a little bit of equipping, and we have the ability to do that. We’ve got videos, I can zoom in, all kinds of ways that I can help churches be ready to open those doors. And what I have been telling people is, without sounding super cheesy, you build it, they will come. I have found whenever you tell people in a very genuine, open way, I want to help. I’ve got the tools to do that. They trust you, and so, they they show up, so kind of getting back to your question you know, if people are interested in getting one up and going contact me, Freedom that Lasts.com. There’s a button right on there that will send an email directly to me, even if people are just curious and if there are people who are listening to this and they have, you know, either a light affinity towards CR or a very strong connection to CR and they love to talk more about that. I’m even open to that as well. I want to help as best I can.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Great. This has been great. Ben, thank you so much. And for so many people who may have never heard of Freedom that Lasts. There are ministries out there that are biblically faithful and trying to help churches to minister in these particular areas. So, thank you, brother. Appreciate your time.\\xa0\\nBen Marshall: Absolutely.

      "{'title': 'Crafting Temptation and Repentance Plans to Help Addicts', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Keith Palmer', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'Keith Palmer addresses two pieces of the counseling approach: helping addicts with temptation and repentance.', 'body': \"I want to begin with a text, because I don’t know if you feel like this, but when I come to a topic like addiction it absolutely overwhelms me. This is not an easy topic and this is not an easy situation. This is hard ministry in many ways. It’s heartbreaking ministry.\\nI want to anchor what we’re going to talk about in practical ways in dealing with temptation and repentance in a text. We need to stand on a truth of God’s Word that will give us hope.\\nEphesians 3:20-21 says, “Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.”\\nBrothers and sisters, God is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think. We need to remember that when we come alongside difficult cases like addiction. God is able to do these things. He is able. He is powerful. We come to ministry with a confidence not in ourselves, but in Him.\\nWith that in mind, let me introduce you to a couple that we’ll call Mike and Molly. Let’s say they’re in your church and they’re getting to know people, building relationships, and as you get to know them you get a tragic phone call that this dear couple is struggling in significant ways. As you engage in ministry, here’s the story as it envelops in front of you: Both Mike and Molly have a criminal record and have spent some time in jail. They have a history of drug use, they both have psychological diagnoses, and one of them is on a psychotropic medication. The drug that they have been most recently struggling with is meth. Amongst the other struggles, they’re involved in various sexual sin—adultery, pornography. They’ve had some physical issues as well, some health issues that have led to them being on pain meds, which is one more source of potential addiction. They’ve recently come from an intensive two-week rehab treatment. As is so often the case when someone is discharged from a rehab facility involving addiction, they relapse almost immediately.\\nWhy is that? So often—even though there’s a time and place for rehab where we can stabilize and detox them, which are wise things to do—typically in that setting you’re not addressing the heart. You’re not helping them to see the gospel of Christ and how a relationship with Him is really the first step toward any sort of change and growth. The other thing I’ve noticed working with people that come out of rehab is there’s maybe some skills,\\xa0 some practical things that are given, but there is not a robust temptation plan that is put into place. The reality is this side of heaven, even as believers, we continue to be tempted. People coming out of addiction are going to be tempted again. Part of what you and I do as biblical counselors, as brothers and sisters in Christ, is we come alongside to help them to wisely prepare for the next temptation, because it’s not a question of “if” but “when?”\\nBiblical repentance, according to the Bible, is the engine of change in the Christian life. Click To Tweet\\nThe other thing that doesn’t happen so often in residential treatment is there’s no talk of biblical repentance. Biblical repentance, according to the Bible, is the engine of change in the Christian life. So that is what we spend our time talking about, facilitating, assisting with, and ministering to our dear brothers and sisters that are struggling.\\nBack to Mike and Molly. They come out of rehab, they immediately relapse. There’s relational conflict in their marriage. They don’t have any problem solving skills. They don’t know how to communicate. They don’t know how to apply the gospel that they’re professing to these challenges that they’re facing. You come to find also that they owe their dealer money, and the dealer knows that. The dealer knows that they’ve just gotten out of rehab and that’s another challenge. In an attempt to pay off the dealer, guess what happens? They’re tempted again and they fall right back in it. How do we help a Mike and Molly? How do we help somebody struggling with drug addiction? Or maybe not drug addiction, maybe it’s pornography, maybe it’s sexual addiction, maybe it’s video game addiction—there’s all these life dominating sins that are enslaving, that have similar profiles. That’s what I want to talk to you about.\\nTo be clear, my goal here is not to talk about a comprehensive approach to counseling addiction. For that I would recommend works on addiction by Mark Shaw and Ed Welch. What I want to talk about is just two pieces of the counseling approach, namely, how do we help them with temptation? And how do we help them with repentance?\\nThe Motivation\\nThe first question is, why should we do that? Why should we plan for temptation and repentance? Because they’re going to be tempted. Our role as their brother or their sister in Christ is to help them to prepare for that with the gospel, with the text of Scripture.\\nIf we’re going to help them to change, we have to facilitate repentance. What does that mean? Probably the area that I have the most experience with when we think about addiction would be a pornography or a sexual addiction sort of situation. Do you know what the typical person does who fails in sexual sin? What do they do when they fail? Do they repent? Do they walk through applying the gospel? Do they claim the promises of Christ? Do they put off and put on? Do they analyze what happened and make no provision for the flesh? The vast majority of Christians—even well-taught Christians—when they fail, they might pray, they might feel bad, they might tell somebody, but the point is they almost always fall short of true repentance. There is no change apart from true repentance. We have to help them to put that in place in their life.\\nWe need to help them plan for temptation because they're going to be tempted, and we need to help them with repentance because that is the engine for change. Click To Tweet\\nWe need to help them plan for temptation because they’re going to be tempted, and we need to help them with repentance because that is the engine for change.\\nJust so you know a flyover of how I think about counseling, I have a football analogy for you. You have an offense, you have a defense, and you have special teams. Let me just walk you through why we’re approaching counseling in this way. Turn with me to Psalm 119:9 and I want to demonstrate why having an offensive plan in addiction counseling is so important.\\nWhy ought we have an offensive plan, a strategy for helping people to grow? And by offensive plan, what I mean is: We’re trying to put points on the board. Meaning, we are trying to help our brother or sister to grow in their walk with God. We want them to be thriving in a walk with God, growing in the spiritual disciplines, active in their local church, and practicing the one anothers, and all of these things the Bible says a believer ought to be doing and pursuing in order to grow.\\nYou will see that there is a correlation between the extent that a Christian is thriving in their walk with God and their success in handling temptation. Often the person that’s struggling in their walk with God, they’re struggling in their local church, they’re struggling to be active, they’re struggling with even basic spiritual disciplines—they are easy targets for temptation and for the enemy. We want to have a plan that goes something like this. Look at Psalm 119:9, which says, “How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.”\\nTypically, we love the jump to the AWANA verse, which is another verse down. Verse 11 says, “I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.” Yes, we need to memorize God’s Word. That is essential. We know that from Jesus’ temptation in Matthew 4. We know the importance of that, but do not skip verse 10.\\nVerse 10 says, “With my whole heart I seek you;\\xa0let me not wander from your commandments!” Do you see that the first strategy in helping somebody—anybody, but particularly somebody who might be struggling with addiction—is to help them to grow to a place where they are seeking God with all their hearts. What’s that? That’s offense. That’s spiritually putting points on the board. That’s growing and thriving in their walk with God. It’s growing in the spiritual disciplines. It’s being active in their local church. It’s practicing the one anothers. It’s growing in a general sense in their walk with God.\\nWhen you are thriving in your walk with God, you’re going to handle temptation a lot better. It’s not going to be as enticing to you. As we deal with addiction counseling, that offensive strategy is important. How can we help people to grow in their walk with God?\\nWhat about defense? The point of defense is to deal with temptation. When temptation comes, how do you resist? How do you say no? How do you claim and draw near to the promises in the gospel and say no to sin and say yes to righteousness? We think of a text like 1 Corinthians 10:13, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.” Living out that verse, applying that verse, and learning to resist temptation is a huge piece of the counseling puzzle when we’re trying to help people coming out of addiction. We’re going to come back to that in more detail in just a moment, but let me explain special teams.\\nThe football folks out there know that special teams comes on the field when it’s 4th and long, when you’re in trouble, when the offense has failed frankly. I think of special teams as repentance. When failure has happened, what do we do? We think of texts like Psalm 32 and Psalm 51, which inform and outline for us what godly repentance looks like. We need repentance because repentance is how people change. That’s the flyover of how I would approach counseling—an offense being a proactive walk with God, a defense being resisting temptation, and then repentance to answer: What do we do when we fail? How do we handle failure?\\nTemptation\\nIf you study the Bible in terms of the texts that inform us about temptation, the first thing we really learn is so simple that we’re prone to overlook it. We call this the “Joseph method” of dealing with sin and temptation. How does that go? Potiphar’s wife approaches you and she uses the subtle approach (“lie with me”), what do you do? You leave your coat and run. You flee. And I want to show you as we come back to Mike and Molly in a minute how something as simple as fleeing temptation is incredibly significant in the moment.\\nYou know what most people do when they’re tempted in front of that computer screen, or they’re tempted in that crowd of friends, or they’re tempted in that occasion? They stay there. They don’t move geographically. When what that young man sitting in the dorm room needs to do when his roommates are out and his laptop is up and he’s tempted to look at something on his computer, what he needs to do is flee the dorm room.\\nMaybe it’s a peer group that is tempting, maybe it’s entertainment. What they need to do is leave and move to that place away from the temptation. The Bible tells us this all over the place. We need to flee youthful lusts. The Bible tells us that Joseph flees and runs. You need to prepare for temptation before you’re in temptation. We do not do well in the moment of temptation.\\nEven if it’s something as simple as taking that extra cookie when my diet says no. You don’t sit there and deliberate in front of that cookie and ask, “Do I need to take it how? How many have I had today?” You make a plan ahead of time so that in the moment of temptation all you do is implement the plan. What I love about the Scriptures is the Scriptures recognize our frailness. Dealing with temptation doesn’t need to be a 15-point outline of Greek terms and high-dollar theological principles, it needs to be simple, it needs to be known, so that in the moment of temptation you implement it.\\nThe first thing the Bible tells us is flee, run, get away, remove yourself from the place of temptation. Call me old school, but I tell dating couples this wisdom. If you’re committed as a function of your gospel testimony and your faith in the Lord Jesus to not compromise physically with your girlfriend or boyfriend, I can give you a surefire way to do that. Don’t ever put yourself in a situation where you might. If you stay around other people, that probably won’t happen. You flee. You move to a place or you stay in a place where you’re probably not going to do that.\\nLet me show you another principle, this time from Romans. As we come to Romans 13, it’s built on the gospel presentation that Paul gives earlier, where we are applying the gospel, we’re living out the gospel. In Romans 13:14, Paul writes this to the Roman Christians, “But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.”\\nNotice that before he talks about defense, he talks about offense: “put on the Lord Jesus Christ.” Be active in your walk with God, recall gospel promises, claim your position in Christ, remind yourself, rehearse your adoption, your justification, your redemption, the Spirit in you—those wonderful truths that we know we have because of our union with Christ.\\nPut on the Lord Jesus Christ actively, and then “make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.” That phrase “make no provision” actually means don’t make a plan.\\nLet’s apply that for a moment. I was working with a young man many years ago, a college student struggling with pornography and he’s talking to me, we’re having a counseling session. He says, “Oh man, I blew it last week. I looked at pornography again.” I asked, “Well, what happened?” We went back the day it happened, and it was about 7 or 8 p.m. What we discovered, as I talk through his day and try to figure out what was going on and what he was thinking, was there was an event that happened at 9:30 a.m. that morning. As we converse and I listen, as we talked about it together to try to understand the pattern, the challenges that he faced, he came to discover that his temptation to look at pornography at 7 or 8 p.m. happened at 9:30 a.m. that morning.\\nSomething happened and he violated this verse. He violated it in one way in the sense that in that moment of temptation, he did not actively put on the Lord Jesus Christ. He didn’t recall his justification, his redemption, the fact that the Holy Spirit and dwells within him and his body is not his own because he’s been bought with a price so he should glorify God with his body. He didn’t put on the Lord Jesus Christ, but the other thing he did that violates the other side of this verse is he started to make a plan.\\nHe started to think, “Okay, I got classes today, I have a lunch meeting, I’ll go to work.” He started to concoct in his plan that time of day when he would be available to pornography. The wisdom of this verse says you have to stop it right there. You have to stop it the moment that temptation arises. You don’t make a plan, you repent immediately at even the thought of beginning to think about that. That’s what “no provision” means—don’t make a plan.\\nSolomon warns his son the same thing in Proverbs 7. Make a commitment before the Lord that as soon as that comes into your mind, you need to stop and recall and put on the Lord Jesus Christ and repent of making any sort of plan.\\nThe other text I want you to see is the one I mentioned a moment ago, 1 Corinthians 10. Let’s unpack this text. What we’re doing here is we’re unpacking some texts about temptation and then we’re going to use what we learn to make what I’m going to call a temptation plan. This talk is about crafting temptation and repentance plans. We want to learn what the Bible tells us about temptation and then we’ll flesh it out in a plan, and then I’ll show you in Mike and Molly’s situation how we help them to do those things.\\nFirst Corinthians 10:13 says this about temptation: This is common to man. By the way, if you’re a new biblical counselor, you have to be careful with that. We don’t want to say to our counselees, “Oh, it’s no big deal! Everybody goes through that.” That’s not what the intent means. The intent of what Paul is saying is that as fallen people our temptations are similar. One of the ways that sin gets a foothold in our hearts is I start to isolate myself and think I’m the only one that’s ever dealt with this. This verse is designed to remind us that it is common. That’s not to downplay a person’s struggle or to say that their struggle isn’t real or difficult or doesn’t have nuances that may be unique to them. It’s just saying you’re not the only one. Under the hood we all struggle in similar ways.\\nNotice of the theology of the verse. As biblical counselors you understand that the theology of the verse is the main point. What the text tells us about God is the thing to focus on, and of course what this tells us about God is that He is faithful. God is faithful. He’s reliable, you can depend on Him. You don’t have to wonder in your moment of temptation, “If I cry out to Him, is He going to give me that grace and mercy that He tells me in Hebrews 4 will help me in my day of need?” He’s reliable. He’s faithful. I can trust that whenever I turn to Him, He’s going to help me.\\nWhat is He going to help me with? Two things: the Bible says God is always faithful in the temptation to limit the severity of the temptation, so that it’s not too much for you and I to bear as we lean on Christ. That last part is important—we’re leaning on Christ. It’s not too much to bear, God sovereignly limits the severity of the temptation, so that it is not too much for me to resist as I cling to Christ in that temptation. That’s the first point of how God is faithful.\\nHe says that with the temptation He will provide the way of escape, so that you will be able to endure it. God often brings this promise about not by removing the temptation in the moment, but by giving you extra grace to endure it. Click To Tweet\\nThe second one is that He provides a way of escape. Be honest: What we want this verse to mean is He gives a way of escape where the temptation goes away. That’s what we want—and praise the Lord, sometimes He does that. But notice that’s not the direction the text goes. He says that with the temptation He will provide the way of escape, so that you will be able to endure it.\\nGod often brings this promise about not by removing the temptation in the moment, but by giving you extra grace to endure it. That’s so important because in that moment your temptation will feel overwhelming, it will feel like it’s too much, you won’t see a way of escape. You’ll think, “Grace just isn’t going to work this time.” What do we do? We claim the promise of God, we believe that God is faithful. We trust what the text says, not what I’m feeling in the moment. God is faithful in that.\\nLet me show you another text that we have to talk about when we think about temptation. James 1:13-15 tells us, “Let no one say when he is tempted, ‘I am being tempted by God,’ for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.”\\nTwo things we learn very quickly here is that temptation comes through our sinful desires. This is very important. Are there external factors in temptation? Absolutely. Are there circumstantial factors? Yes. Are there people? Yes, there are that contribute to temptation. But James takes his sharpie out and puts the Red X over our own fallen sinful desires as the real issue in temptation. It’s what we’re wanting. It’s what we’re desiring. Notice also—and this is so insightful, if you can translate this into a counseling agenda, you will really help people—James helps us to see that temptation gains power because of deception. Verse 14 says, “Each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lusts.” That word enticed is really important. It means to lure by desire.\\nAny fisherman here will understand the purpose of a bass lure. The purpose of a bass lure is to lie to the fish. To deceive the fish. It’s supposed to make the little bass swimming in the lake think, “Man, this is lunch. This is easy!” When he doesn’t realize there’s a hook there. He is deceived by that lure. He’s deceived into thinking this is something good. This is something I need. This is something valuable, and then he bites down on it and what he thought would help him and nourish him actually kills him.\\nThat’s the word James use here. It’s to lure by deception. Why is this so important? When you’re dealing with people struggling with addictions, there is a belief system in their desires that feeds their temptation. The reason temptation has power, the reason our sinful desires have power, is because of the lies we embrace behind them.\\nAll you have to do to see this is on Sunday afternoon when you’re watching football, just watch the commercials. Every commercial is designed to lure. Let’s say let’s say it’s a Ford F-150, Texas edition truck. I have a 1999 Camry. It works just fine, it’s great. But I’m watching this commercial and I’m drooling on my couch, thinking, “Man, I do need a new truck!” They’ve got the happy family and they’re pulling a wonderful ski boat behind it. Before long I’m thinking I need a new truck. Why? Because I’m deceived into thinking I need that to be happy, or I need that to have a family like that. That deception, that false belief, feeds my wants and gives power to temptation.\\nThat’s important because when you come alongside someone who’s struggling with addiction, or really any sort of sinful desire, one of the ways you’re going to help them is you have to unmask the temptation to discover the deception that is behind those sinful desires. What are they wanting? Why do they want it? What lies are they believing? Is it they’re going to be happy, is it they’re trying to escape something, is it an expectation that, “I need this, I deserve this”?\\nWhen you begin to unpack the belief system that removes the power. It’s so amazing. When you dismantle the deception behind your sinful desires with the truth of God’s Word, it deflates and renders powerless your temptation. That’s what James is telling us. We need to uncover that.\\nThe last verse we’re going to look at very briefly is in Hebrews 4. I put this in here because we need to remember that in the moment of temptation—even though we have wonderful principles, wonderful truth, wonderful practices, and we’ve unpacked some of those very briefly here—we don’t turn to a principle, we don’t turn to a theological point, we turn to the person of Jesus who gives us grace to live out that theology in the moment.\\nHe was tempted in all things as we are, the Bible tells us, yet without sin. That’s amazing—we can go to Jesus. In fact, you can do this, you can go to Jesus and say, “I am struggling with this temptation.” Maybe it’s an addiction. Maybe it’s some other thing. Say, “Lord Jesus I’m struggling with this today.” And you know what He’s going to say if you do that? “I know what that’s like. I can relate.” Because He is a sympathetic high priest, the Scripture tells us. He has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin. He’s the Son of God, He never sins. Therefore, He can come and help us. He knows what it’s like, He knows the weight of temptation, He can relate to the pull—and yet He resisted. That’s the person to help us! That’s the one we want to talk to.\\nHebrews 4:16 says, “Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.” When we go to that throne of grace, we don’t receive condemnation. We receive grace and mercy to help in our time of need. When we’re struggling with temptation, when we’re helping with those struggling with addictions, we want to help them to see that turning to Christ is the most important thing that they’re going to do.\\nHow do we take all this now and translate this into a robust temptation plan. I say robust, but actually it’s going to be pretty simple. Robust meaning we’re trying to apply biblical truth to it. Let me start with something really simple. The idea behind this is we want to help somebody to craft a temptation plan, so that the moment they begin to feel temptation, they know exactly how to respond. That means it has to be simple, not complicated, and its goal is to break the building momentum of temptation.\\nWe can all put our hands up and say we know what that growing momentum of temptation is like. We know that, we’ve experienced that our own hearts. A temptation plan is like giving you a spiritual offramp as the road of temptation accelerates.\\nWhen our kids were very young and we were trying to help them to deal with their own temptation, we came up with this: Stop, get away, pray, obey. Here you say, “That’s really simple. That’s not very profound.” Exactly! Because you’re not trying to be profound in the moment of temptation. You’re trying to help put a simple outline into the mind of the person so that as soon as they’re tempted, they know what to do.\\nThis is what we taught our kids. First you stop. You have that moment you realize, “What I’m doing is not honoring to God.” You get away—the Joseph method. You remove yourself, insofar as you can, from the place of temptation. Then you apply Hebrews 4—you turn to Christ in prayer. You call on Him. You ask for grace and mercy to help. Can I just say as a parent of growing kids—and you may have kids in your home, you may have grandkids—we need to be teaching children how to turn to Christ first, not last when they’re tempted. This is something we need to be building into children.\\nStop. Getaway. Pray.\\xa0What’s obey? Obey is doing the things that we just learned—make no provision for the flesh. I’m going to stop, and I’m not going to make any more plan. It’s turning to grace and mercy to help. It’s stopping and saying, “Wait a minute. What was I wanting in this moment?” That’s what James tells us, it’s our wants that lead to temptation. “Is there a lie that I’m believing?” That’s what we do.\\nIt seems like every argument in our home has something to do with Legos. We are in the Lego stage of life. Some of you may be in the Lego stage of life. The lie might be something as as simple as this: “I think I should be able to play with my brothers Legos whenever I want to, but he can never use mine.” That is the theological operating system of my 10-year-old that leads to sinful desires, that leads to temptation, that leads to an argument. I’ll stop in that moment and come alongside my son to ask, “Is that is that true? Do you deserve that? Is that the way you honor your brother by thinking you have the right to do that?”\\nOnce he sees that what Philippians 2 says is true, that he should actually consider his brother as more important than himself. When he really truly believes that, what happens to his sinful desire to take his brother’s Legos? It goes away. And that temptation in that moment dissolves because when you deal with the deception behind the desire, it deflates the balloon of temptation.\\nStop, get away, pray, obey. How do we turn that into a “big person” plan? This is what I do with somebody struggling with pornography. Flee to a safe place, pray for help, call your accountability partner, and review counseling notes. That assumes that I have prepared them. This is typically what I’ll do: When we go over texts like James 1 or Romans 13, maybe Matthew 5 about radical amputation, putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, gospel promises—I’ll have them make a little card and keep it in their Bible of those promises. Or if they’re under 40, I’ll have them put it on their phone, so it’s always available to them. So they know to get away to a safe place, call out to Jesus for grace and help, call their accountability partner, and then review those notes, review those homework assignments, those promises. Renewing their mind in the Scripture will expose the lies. That’s what will help them to claim promises that God is faithful. He’s going to help them. Then analyze and make changes.\\nThe way we do this in our church is the accountability partner is usually not the biblical counselor. It’s kind of a Titus 2 level discipler who’s working with the biblical counselor and to provide accountability and help. They know how to come alongside and give instructions about what to do. Now I’ve found that when you’re trying to do this with a counselee, there may be some specific things you need to do to tweak the temptation plan.\\nLet me tell you some of the things that I see in helping addicts and helping people struggling with temptation that get them into trouble with temptation. The first thing that they’re doing is they don’t stop making a plan. That young man that I helped years ago at 9:30 a.m. at his college something happens. He sees something, he hears something, and he begins to be tempted to look at pornography. People that continue to fall into temptation have never gotten into the habit of stopping the temptation by not making a plan. That may be an area that you need to help. Check that out: Are they continuing to make a plan? Are they killing temptation as soon as it happens?\\nThe Puritan John Owen said no man will make any progress in his spiritual life who does not walk over the neck of his lusts. Click To Tweet\\nThe Puritan John Owen said no man will make any progress in his spiritual life who does not walk over the neck of his lusts. That’s good advice from a wise pastor, isn’t it? You kill temptation the moment that it happens. You stop making a plan.\\nOther people don’t flee. Maybe it’s a young couple in your church and they keep compromising sexually in their dating relationship. You ask, “Well, what are you doing about that?” They’re doing the same thing, the same way, expecting different results. Maybe it’s not wise to hang out in her apartment by yourself. Maybe you need to not do that. Maybe in that situation in the vehicle when you typically get in trouble and are tempted physically, you need to make a plan get out of that vehicle as soon as that temptation arises. They’re not stopping the making of a plan. They’re not fleeing.\\nMaybe they continue to believe the same lies: “This will satisfy me. I need this. I deserve this.” We need to deal with deception at the level of lies.\\nSome people just say this: “I can’t.” You know in dealing with addicts that’s a real issue. They really think it’s too much. There is no way they can say no. That’s where we have to come back to the gospel. As I read in Ephesians 3—God is able to do in the gospel what you think is impossible. Then we live trusting His promises, not based on the conclusions of our feelings in the moment of temptation. Feelings are wonderful. They’re a part of the Christian life, but they were never meant to be the Google Map navigation system of your Christian life.\\nDid you know feelings are the most unreliable in temptation? Your feelings are shouting lies about how this is completely impossible and it’s completely justified for you to do it one more time. We come back to 1 Corinthians 10:13, “God is faithful.” You say to your brother or sister, “Do you believe that? You have to act based on faith in the promises of God in that moment and not based on how you feel.” So you fine-tune that plan for your counselees.\\nCase Study\\nLet’s go back to Mike and Molly, the case scenario there. And of course, these are fictitious people, but based on a composite of cases. They’re struggling, their main struggle as the counseling started was with drug abuse. They kept relapsing back into meth use. We had a biblical counseling team—there were probably about 8 people in these dear folks’ local church who were involved in the counseling. This is a function of our ecclesiology. Biblical counseling is one part of a whole theology of what the church is and should be. Discipleship is happening from the nursery to the pulpit. At least that’s what we see in Scripture. At all levels discipleship is happening. As you help someone like Mike and Molly, it’s not a skilled biblical counselor. It’s a team of brothers and sisters that come alongside in all sorts of different ways and walk with these dear people, and help them, are there for them, provide accountability, and practical help.\\nThe couple things we did with them with temptation is we put in an accountability system where they were to call immediately when temptation arose. We coupled that with people in the church that would literally go by their house twice a day to check on them because that’s where they would typically use. There was a pastor who would make random phone calls. They were told, “You always pick up the phone.” And if they didn’t pick up the phone, there was someone from the church dispatched to their house to check on them. You say, “Really?” I say, “Really!” That’s the church. That’s what we’re called to be. We love one another, we come alongside one another, we bear one another’s burdens. In a practical way, especially in a difficult situation like addiction, that’s the level of care that the church of Jesus Christ ought to be fulfilling.\\nWe also talked to them about getting out of the house. They’re probably not going to go out into the street in front of all their neighbors and all their friends and shoot up. They’re probably not going to do that. That was another thing that we implemented to get them out of the house. So fleeing, calling, people coming over to check on them. Those were things that we put as part of their temptation plan. I’ll tell you how we coupled that with repentance and some other things in a moment.\\nRepentance\\nLet’s talk next about repentance, because the reality is sometimes people are going to say yes to their temptation instead of no. We need to put practical steps in place for when a failure occurs. When they fall into sin, what do we want them to do?\\nWe’ll hit some of the highlights of what repentance is from Psalm 51. If you are a biblical counselor, or if you just want to be a growing Christian, you understand that you need to be very acquainted with repentance. I often say to our counseling students, “You need to be able to fall out of bed in the morning before you’ve had your Starbucks and be able to explain and facilitate repentance.” It’s that important.\\nWhat does that look like? We know this is one of two Psalms that David wrote as a reflection of his repentance. In fact, the historic superscript under the title Psalm 51 tells us that this was a Psalm that David wrote after Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone into Bathsheba. I just want to hit some bullet points here on what repentance is, and then I want to walk you through how we might apply that to an addiction case.\\nDavid says in Psalm 51:3, “For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.” Now this may be really simple and really basic, but you cannot repent until you’ve acknowledged that you’ve done something wrong. When we’re in defense mode, when we’re in denial mode, when we’re in minimizing mode, when we’re in blame-shifting mode, we are not in a place where we can yet repent. David says he acknowledges his sin. I see that, I admit that. There has to be an understanding and an acknowledgement there. Notice also there has to be confession.\\nDavid says in verse 4, “Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you may be justified in your words and blameless in your judgment.” David is illustrating what the word confession actually means. The word confession literally means to say the same thing. What that’s getting at is in repentance and confession, I am agreeing with God’s assessment of what I just did. I’m not making excuses. I’m not in denial. I’m not blaming someone else. I am agreeing with God, fully admitting that His just sentence on my life in light of what I’ve just done is right. That’s when David says there: You’re justified when you speak, you’re blameless when you judge. God’s Word has brought an accurate assessment and confession means that I am heartily agreeing with God’s assessment.\\nThirdly, there’s godly remorse. We see that again here in verse 3, and David expands on that in verse 8, saying, “Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have broken rejoice.” In his contrition over his sin, he says it literally feels like somebody has broken my bones.\\nIn verse 17, we see the same thing. He says, “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit;\\xa0a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” This is hard to detect in counseling sometimes isn’t it? It’s hard to differentiate a godly sorrow from a worldly sorrow. I’ll tell you that the presence of godly humility as indicated by verse 17—a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart—those are good indicators that is the right kind of sorrow.\\nNotice also there’s a request for forgiveness. This is part of repentance. He says that in verses 1-2,\\n“Have mercy on me, O God,according to your steadfast love;according to your abundant mercyblot out my transgressions.Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity,and cleanse me from my sin!”\\nHe’s saying three times in three different ways, “Lord, forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me.” Blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly, cleanse me from my sin—those are all picturesque ways of saying, “Lord, I need the cleansing of your forgiveness.” He’s asking for forgiveness.\\nRepentance is not complete until there is an awareness of what needs to change, and there is a commitment by God's grace to enact those changes. Click To Tweet\\nFinally—and this is the one that gets looked over so often—is a commitment. Repentance is not complete until there is an awareness of what needs to change, and there is a commitment by God’s grace to enact those changes. Psalm 51:10 says, “Create in me a clean heart, O God,\\xa0and renew a right spirit within me.” He says, “Lord, don’t leave me like this!” He’s acknowledged to God, he’s confessed his sin, he’s asked for forgiveness. But what is he still saying? “Lord, I don’t want to do this again. I need you to change my heart. Clean my heart. Give me a new heart. Renew me from the inside out. Lord, don’t let me stay like this. Change me.” That the heart of true repentance—there needs to be some level of commitment to change, a request for God to change us from the inside out, and that gets played out in very practical ways.\\nHow do you take that very quick look at the the doctrine of repentance and those five key steps of repentance and turn that into a robust repentance plan? I’m going to focus on pornography because I think this is probably one of the things that we are most likely to see in our counseling and discipling ministries.\\nLet’s take what we’ve learned about repentance, and this is step-by-step what I take my counselees through in terms of actually practicing repentance. Then we’ll circle back and I’ll explain what we did with Mike and Molly in the case that I mentioned. The first thing we’re going to do: We’re going to lead them to confess the sin to God and to seek His forgiveness. We saw that Psalm 51, also Psalm 32 models this. First John 1:9 says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” That’s confession—we’re walking through what we’re trying to help them to do as a function of repentance. We also want to help them to confess the sin and seek forgiveness from those whom you sinned against. Remember confession is always vertical, and sometimes horizontal. It’s always vertical because all sin is always against God. It’s sometimes horizontal if that sin has been also directed towards someone else whom we have hurt or sinned against.\\nLuke 17:3 says, “If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.” That may be going to a spouse, that may be going to an adult child, someone whom our sin has been against in our addiction.\\nWe also want to confess the sin to another brother in Christ. You saw that in the temptation plan that we put together. James 5:16 says we need to confess our sins to one another. It is so important that we don’t try to battle the sins of addiction alone. I had a seminary professor that used to say: “In the church, lone rangers are dead rangers.” That’s good advice. God puts us in a body of brothers and sisters, and we work on these things together. We work through them together. We pray for one another. We help one another. That can’t happen if there’s not open and honest dialogue with a couple of trusted friends.\\nWe also want to take steps of radical amputation to avoid temptation in the future. I think the average Christian who struggles with life-dominating sin thinks, “I’m going to confess it to God and that alone will make it different next time.” Well, that’s not what Scripture says. Confessing to God is a good part—a needed part of the process—but Matthew 5 says, “if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away.” This is radical amputation, meaning you are looking for the things that are tripping you up, and you are getting rid of those things. In pornography, what is that? That’s computer access, it’s locations, it’s friends, it’s relationships, it’s access to the pornography. Removing that through some sort of means is absolutely essential.\\nYou ask, “Well, is cutting off the pornography use really going to help them?” No, because you’ve got to get to their heart. Their heart needs to change, but cutting off the access allows you to bring some stability to that person’s life so that you then can address the heart. It’s very important to apply radical amputation. This is all part of repentance.\\nAs you help them review their failure, ask them this: What actions of righteousness should they be doing? Click To Tweet\\nAs you help them review their failure, ask them this: What actions of righteousness should they be doing? They chose to sin, but there were acts of righteousness that they should have been pursuing. What should I have been doing? If it’s a married guy, I might ask him to do this, “What are 10 specific ways that I can show sacrificial love to my wife?” We’re putting off looking at pornography, the adultery, the sexual sin, what are we replacing that with? Practical steps of biblical love toward this man’s wife. There we are putting off and putting on. We’re putting on the Lord Jesus Christ and we’re making no provision for the flesh. And you have to get to the specific level—10 specific ways. Some counselees may say, “Pastor Keith, I’m going to go home and I’m going to be nicer to my wife.” I say, “Well that’s good, but that’s not specific enough. I want 10 specific ways you can demonstrate sacrificial love to your wife.” I may need to help him with ideas, whether it’s helping with the laundry, maybe it’s giving her a night off—practical ways like that.\\nIf it’s a single guy, it might be 10 ways you can love and serve various people in your church, or your neighborhood, or your workplace. The opposite of lust is biblical love. Lust is self-centered, it’s about me and my gratification. Love is others-oriented, it’s about blessing and serving other people. The way you combat lust is you help that person learn to love people biblically, and then practice it in a practical way. These are ideas to do that.\\nAre there areas of responsibility that I’ve been neglecting? You think of the hours and hours that young people waste viewing pornography when they should be doing profound theological things like their homework, like going to their job on time, like paying attention in doing their job instead of being on their phone all the time. You’re trying to help them to put off and put on steps of righteousness in place of the sin. Personal projects, ministries, household duties—figure out what’s going on there.\\nNext thing, we want to ask God to examine our heart. I have them pray through Psalm 139 (“Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!”)\\nAsk God to examine their hearts. We’re looking for things like self-serving desires and motives, so that we can confess at the heart level. Here’s another thing: What God-honoring and others-serving desires and motives should you replace them with? This is all a part of repentance. They’re not going to change until they start walking through steps like this, or they’re just going to go right back to doing the same thing.\\nAsk them, “When do you think this particular temptation began?” There’s always a pattern in addiction. Your job as the brother or sister, the biblical counselor, is to discover that pattern, listen, figure it out, and then help them to put plans into place to not fall back into that pattern. When we’re dealing with pornography, we might be thinking about the pleasure, the draw of the pornography. Believe it or not, people don’t all look at pornography for the same reasons. I love Tim Chester’s book Closing the Window. He explains how there are different drawers to pornography. He connects, for example the person who’s looking for a refuge in their pornography, he counters that with some sort of aspect of the character of God. For example, God is great. He is sovereign over our lives. Then a gospel virtue to combat that sinful desire that leads the pornography. I’ve found that very helpful as we try to help these men and women that are struggling.\\nIn what other areas of your life do you see selfishness and living for self? This is really insightful as the Bible helps us to see. I can guarantee you the person that is living for self in addiction—that is not the only place in their life that they’re living for self.\\nPart of how you battle this is not just by putting both guns of the counseling cannon on the addiction. You look for all the ways in their life that they are living for self. It may be little compromises. It may be in entertainment. It may be in chores around the house. It may be that they’re not being faithful at work or in school. You identify all those things and you help them to see that the way you’re going to help them with living for self in the addiction is helping them to identify all these other ways they’re living for self, and then learning to live for God not just in the midst of the addiction, but in those other areas. At work, with family, in eating, and leisure. We help them to think through all those areas to identify living for self and replace that with living for God.\\nBy God’s grace what commitments to action do you need to make? This is 1 Timothy 4:7, which says, “discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.” We always want to anchor our repentance plan in the doctrine of union with Christ. It’s only through a believer’s connection with Jesus that they can have any help and hope for change. We come to this not from a standpoint that says, “Here’s your list. Now go repent.” We say, “Here are the steps of repentance and you stand on the gospel. You cling to Christ, you lean on the Spirit’s work in you to put these things into practice.”\\nWith Mike and Molly, how do we do this? What did repentance look like for them? First with radical amputation from Matthew 5, there were some relationships that needed to end. For example, with the drug dealer they should not have had a relationship with. We had them change their phone numbers. Well, guess what? Drug dealers are smart. They got their new numbers. We had to help them change their numbers multiple times as an application of Matthew 5. They actually had to move across town to a different community as a function of their repentance, so that they would be in a position when they weren’t going to be tempted. As I mentioned, there were five people that were visiting them two times a day, there were random calls by one of the pastors.\\nThey fell one day. They came and talked a biblical counselor. The counselor asked, “Well, what happened did you go buy drugs?” They said, “No we found some drugs we forgot about in the closet.” So, you know what this dear church did? They mobilized a team of godly people that went over and turned their house upside down and found every bit of paraphernalia, drugs, anything associated with that lifestyle, and we got rid of it. That’s how the church cares. That’s how we facilitate repentance.\\nWe had to help them with conflict resolution. As they were tempted to drugs, one of the things that we discovered that precipitated the addiction was marital conflict. They didn’t know what to do with marital conflict. They didn’t know how to apply the gospel graces that they had in Christ to conflict in terms of confession and forgiveness. They would turn to drugs as their way of dealing with the stress, anxiety, fears, and frustrations of that.\\nIt's applying the normal means of grace in wisdom and care in the context of a loving and committed local church that helps the Mike's and Molly's of the world to turn away from addiction and to grow in gospel graces for His glory. Click To Tweet\\nWe walked them through conflict resolution—how to do confession, how to do forgiveness. We had to increase accountability. One of the things that we discovered in working with these dear folks is one of the areas when they were usually tempted is when they got a paycheck. They got money in hand, and the temptation was, “We go cash it, and we get drugs, and then maybe we get groceries.” We identified a godly person in the church who was savvy with finances. They actually gave them account access, online access. Then a trusted church member saw when the paycheck hits, and can ask, “Is it all there? Is it not all there?” That financial person really helped them as a function of their repentance, as a way to help them apply gospel principles to that situation.\\nBy God’s grace the church came around them and helped them to repent, helped them to address temptation and I’m here to tell you the gospel of Jesus wins in this. It was an overwhelming situation. It was difficult. There was lots of relapse, but trusting that God is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think. You’ll notice there’s nothing that we’ve talked about that’s some super secret. I mean, it’s all been in here for 2,000 years. It’s applying the normal means of grace in wisdom and care in the context of a loving and committed local church that helps the Mike’s and Molly’s of the world to turn away from addiction and to grow in gospel graces for His glory.\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeith Palmer serves as an ACBC Fellow, Board Member, and associate pastor of Grace Bible Church in Granbury, TX.\", 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

Mark holds a Doctor of Ministry degree in biblical counseling and he’s been ACBC certified since 2002. He currently serves as the Director of Counseling for Grace Fellowship Church in Kentucky where a familiar face to ACBC, Brad Bigney, is the pastor. Taron Defevers, who is our Communications Coordinator, was able to catch up with Mark and have a discussion on the issue of addiction and, specifically, addiction intervention.\\n\\nTaron Defevers:\\xa0Thanks, Dale. Mark, much of your ministry has been involved with addiction ministry. We’re really thankful for all the work and publications that you’ve put out there serving biblical counselors in the church with addictions ministry. You recently spoke at an ACBC conference about addiction intervention and we’d like to discuss that a little bit on the podcast today. Could you help us by first describing what you mean when you use the term addiction intervention?\\nMark Shaw:\\xa0The term “addiction intervention” is a secular term understood more in that realm, but with the problem of opioid abuse and increased drug addiction, biblical counselors need to be able to understand that concept and offer that as an opportunity for family members to get help for loved ones. To intervene literally means to come between disputing people or groups to intercede or mediate. This is a reconciliation, a peacemaking opportunity, and our definition biblically is a call to bring God into the situation. It’s a call to repentance and/or faith in Christ for the purpose of glorifying God by allowing Him to grant grace and peace into a person’s life.\\nBy intervention, what we mean is that we come in as the third neutral party into a situation where an addict is living life as a drug-addicted person that is out of control and making really bad, sinful choices that are going to destroy their lives and the lives of others. That’s one party. The other party is the family, friends, and loved ones who want this person to get the help that they need—maybe in a residential program, somewhere, a treatment center, a detox, or even live with someone in their home and be discipled personally by a couple or someone. Getting some intensive residential help is typically what the next step is. This intervention is an opportunity to step into the situation and confront, in a gentle, loving way, the addict with the fact that they need help and it’s time now to do something, and to help the family and the addict walk through that process.\\nTaron Defevers:\\xa0You also mentioned that there is a form of pre-intervention that you find helpful before you get into an addiction intervention—there are steps to be taken before that. What are those steps that you recommend?\\nMark Shaw:\\xa0Before the addict ever sets foot into the room, you want to prep the family and the friends who are there to do this intervention. When I think of intervention, I think of a handful of people. The smaller the group the better. It could be as small as maybe a parent or two parents. I like it to be a little bit larger group than that: Maybe a couple of parents, a sibling, a grandmother. Four or five people is probably the ideal size. These folks are sitting in the room and when the addict comes in they tell them how much they care for them and they want to see them change, etc. But before you ever get to that step, you do the pre-intervention work, and that is preparation where you talk about the goals, set the ground rules, and you want to make sure you establish what this intervention is going to look like and what the biblical goals of it are.\\nFor me, the biblical goals are clarity and, before that even, God’s glory. I want the addict to say things to help make things very clear for the family to understand where the addict is. Are they even interested in taking the next step and getting help or are they going to reject that? Either way, you want them to get the help they need. If they don’t, the family needs to understand where the addict is.\\nPart of the pre-intervention work is that you’re helping the family to understand that if the addict rejects, then everyone needs to be on the same page in terms of how they treat the addict moving forward. We can’t have Grandma helping Little Johnny get money and resources he needs for drugs, and the parents are in a different place than she is, and they’re saying no, but he’s going to Grandma for the yes, for the money, and for the things he wants, and he’s just going to spend it on drugs. That’s part of the pre-intervention plan. The plan is: if they reject, here’s what we’re all going to do. We’ve got to stick with this, and if he accepts the help, then that’s great. That’s a win. But, if he doesn’t accept help, a lesser win is having everyone united around how we’re going to treat him and what we’re going to do.\\nThe pre-intervention work is prayer, it’s preparation, and it’s heart preparation. A lot of times, the family members will want counseling for themselves, they’ll want to understand better how they can interact with the addict moving forward, and all of that goes into the pre-intervention stuff. There’s a little bit of work, or maybe a lot of work, that has to go into the pre-intervention preparation part of this whole thing.\\nTaron Defevers:\\xa0Say there’s a Johnny and his family are at our pastor’s church who are listening to this podcast. Grandma’s at the church and the parents are at the church. Maybe Johnny doesn’t attend a church, but he’s struggling with a drug addiction; he’s not wanting to repent of this, but the family is distraught and they come to the pastor. How would you counsel this pastor or equip this pastor to do an intervention and a pre-intervention? What steps would he need to start taking as a pastor or someone who’s a counselor in this church?\\nMark Shaw:\\xa0He calls a meeting first to interview and counsel these family and friends. It’s important to get everybody there at the same time. I always dislike it when someone is added to the group later. Everybody needs to hear the same things and be there. Whoever is going to be part of the intervention needs to be at this first meeting where the pastor can interview and counsel the family and friends and walk them through the process of church discipline in Matthew 18—that part about confronting privately, then involving one or two others, and then telling the church. The pastor can walk them through that.\\nUsually, interventions are that second step. The addict has been confronted, but now we’re involving one or two others to try to bring positive change to the addict. The pastor meets with them, tries to build unity, clarifies biblical goals about glorifying God, sets the ground rules, and then devises a practical plan of repentance with Johnny.\\nThey would talk about where we’re going to meet. We want a private place, a place that respects him and is quiet. It could be a church setting or a conference room type of setting that’s a little more formal. It could be in a home. I’ve done a few of these in homes and that’s fine as well; it just depends on what’s best for that family in that situation. Sometimes in a home, they don’t take it as seriously and other times in a home it’s more warm and inviting. You could go either way. They talk through the where and the when. I don’t love surprises, so they need to plan out a time and a place at a scheduled place for the addict to come.\\nThe tricky part is the addict doesn’t want to be there if they know that they’re going to be confronted. I don’t want to spring it on them and surprise them. There are television shows that do that and that makes for good TV with the drama, the heightened emotion, and the excitement. I try to tone that down by asking the addict to be there and letting them know something about what we’re going to talk about.\\nWe have the where, the when, who attends, who speaks, and what is said. Those are things that the pastor would go through with this family about who’s going to start first, and I would have each family member prepare a statement. It doesn’t have to be long but just a statement outlined. I utilize second Timothy 3:16: “All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.” I utilize the teaching part, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness. I outline that in one of my books:\\xa0The Divine Intervention. I outline that for families to use as a guideline in their content of what they want to say what they should say.\\n\\nRecommended Resources\\n\\nThe Heart of Addiction: A Biblical Perspective, Mark Shaw\\n\\nHow Not to Raise an Addict, Mark Shaw\\n\\nDivine Intervention: Hope and Help for Families of Addicts, Mark Shaw\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Shaw is ACBC certified since 2002 and serves as the Pastor of Counseling at First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Florida- Nocatee Campus                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTaron Defevers is the Communications Director at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'The Secret of Addiction', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 61', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'Dr. Lambert discusses the problem of addiction by defining it and giving practical strategies to overcome it.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: Several weeks ago, Christians were concerned as they learned again of the fall of another pastor. In this particular case, an influential pastor of a large mega-church was revealed to be engaging in an abuse of alcohol as well as some other problems, as reported by various outlets, and he was relieved of his responsibilities of pastoral leadership at his church. These kinds of issues, when they happen, raised all sorts of questions for Christians who want to learn the lessons of these kinds of mistakes and sins on the part of leadership. But the issue that we’re going to address today on the podcast is the issue of addiction. This pastor again confessed in a written statement to letting himself slip into overuse of alcohol, and that gets Christians thinking about addiction. And so, that’s what we’re going to talk about on the podcast this week, right Amy?\\nAmy: Right. So, Heath, I think the best way to start this conversation about addiction is just to ask the basic question. What is addiction?\\nHeath Lambert: What is addiction is an important question to answer because the word is not really a biblical term. That doesn’t mean the idea is not in the Bible; it just means that the language we use to describe the problem today in our contemporary culture is a little bit different than what God uses to describe the problem in His Word. I think one way to capture a biblical reality of addiction is the biblical image of slavery. In the Bible, throughout the pages, there is this understanding of slavery, that human beings can be enslaved to sin. Now, that concept of slavery is something that is larger than addiction. People can be enslaved and enslaved to sin and, indeed, are enslaved to sin in ways that extend beyond what we today call addictions. But that idea of slavery – that I must obey my master – is a very important biblical metaphor. Another reality that we could talk about is the idea of habit. I do this thing that I keep doing over and over and over again and don’t know how to stop. Regardless of what we talk about with regard to addiction, whether it’s slavery or habit, we want to capture the idea that we have a heart that chooses, that wants, that desires, that lusts. And addiction, at the end of the day, is a heart – a greedy heart – that is demanding something to give itself comfort. Apart from that kind of spiritual side of addiction, we would also have to, at certain times, talk about the physical side of addiction. This is when we talk about things like chemical dependency – so alcohol abuse and drug abuse. What begins as a spiritual struggle – let’s say in the case of somebody who’s enslaved to alcohol – they want to check out, they want to break, they don’t want to be thinking about the stressful things that are happening during the day. So they go to alcohol to sort of get themselves some comfort from the stress of the day. Well, as you begin to use that over and over again in a habitual way, your body can become dependent on those chemicals. Your body forgets what it’s like to work without those added chemicals in your body. And so you increase the problem from a spiritual struggle alone, and that develops into a physical problem or a chemical addiction.\\nAmy: So, based off of your definition of addiction, who can be addicted? Can anyone be addicted? Can Christians be addicted? How do you explain this?\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah. Well, I think that’s the question, particularly in light of what happened with this fallen pastor. I think it raises the question, in fact, I’ve been asked three or four times just in the last few days, can a Christian be addicted? I want to say, yes, anybody can be an addict. If you’re a Christian, you can be an addict. If you’re an unbeliever, you can certainly be an addict. The question has added force because this idea of slavery as a biblical metaphor is complicated when you read the whole context of Romans chapter 6, where Paul says you are a slave to sin or a slave to Christ. You’re one or the other. And so we might think that, well, if I’m following Christ, if I’m trusting Him, then I can’t be enslaved to other realities. And what I would say is that metaphor of slavery in Romans 6 is what some theologians call an already not yet idea. Jesus Christ is fully our Master. He has conquered sin and death and the devil on our behalf, and He is as much our Master today as He will be when we’ve been in heaven with Him for ten thousand years. But that doesn’t mean that our life on Earth has caught up with that reality.\\nAnd so in Romans chapter 6, it says, for example, don’t let sin reign in your mortal body. It says, shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? The idea is there’s this challenge that we should not sin even in the context of this Biblical teaching that you have a new Master, whose name is Jesus. And so what Paul is doing there, is he’s saying there is this new reality, Jesus is your Master, but he gives those commands – Jesus is your Master, now don’t sin – and the reason those commands make sense is because we haven’t in our lives fully realized the Lordship of Jesus Christ. And so Romans chapter 6, I think, makes an argument that Christians must believe in order to accomplish actions that we need to take. And so the issue is, if you want to rephrase it and move it away from the slavery issue, we could ask the question a little bit differently. Can Christians, who are not yet fully saved, struggle with real and serious, and persistent problems? Can Christians, who are not yet fully saved, struggle with persistent problems that lead to physical issues and physical addictions? And the answer to those questions is yes. I don’t think the issue in whether you’re a Christian or not is necessarily, do I struggle with an addiction? I think the most important issue is, what am I willing to do in response to the addiction? And that’s where really going to get into the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.\\nAmy: So how would you say that Christians should proceed then? How should they, or what should they do to overcome an addiction?\\nHeath Lambert: Well, we titled the podcast this week the secret of addiction, and that has a bit of a double meaning. The secret of addiction we impart mean to imply that addiction is this secretive thing that people engage in, and this is certainly the case with the pastor in the last couple of weeks who quietly, slowly let himself slide into an overuse of alcohol. It happened secretly, and once it was exposed, we saw what was going on, and it was really bad. But the secret of addiction, also we intend to communicate, that there are a couple of really powerful things. In fact, one, I think of the most important thing that is sort of the secret to defeating addiction. And so for Christians, if you find yourself right now struggling with an addiction, or if you know someone who is struggling with an addiction, the most important thing I think you need to do is the idea that we read about in Colossians chapter 3, verses 9 and 10. And there where the Apostle Paul is talking about instructions to believers as they live the new life in Christ; he says, do not lie to one another since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices and have put on the new self, who’s being renewed to a true knowledge according to the image of the One who created him. The idea is there that Christians need to live honestly. This is what is never happening in the life of someone who is struggling with an addiction. We sometimes say that lusts and lies go hand-in-hand. When you are nurturing the lust of an addiction, you will lie to cover it up. It’s so important because I know so many people who have struggled with addictions over the years, and they want to know, how can I stop drinking? Or how can I stop using drugs? Or how can I stop looking at pornography? Or how can I stop sleeping around? How can I quit gambling? How can I quit smoking? You name it. How do I quit? And one of the most important things we can say to those folks, and one of the most important things we can know if we are one of those folks, is to say the first thing that you need to do is not figure out how to quit drinking, but the first thing you need to figure out how to do is, to tell the truth. If you tell the truth about your weakness, if you will tell the truth about your struggle, then you’re going to open yourself up to a whole category of help and aid that will become available to you. As long as you’re covering it up, as long as you’re denying that there’s a problem, nobody knows that there’s a problem, and so nobody can help you, and you will continue to be stuck. This is a hard thing to do because it requires humility, and that’s an impossible thing to do in a way that honors God without the grace of Jesus Christ. And so the secret of addiction, of growing to be a person who lives openly and honestly, is grounded and founded on the secret of human life, which is, we need a Savior – to humble us, to exalt Himself, and to give us His power to depend on Him by faith, to do what He calls us to do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

My mother who died several years ago battled alcohol addiction for most of her life; she was enslaved to alcohol for over twenty years.

I am thankful for all the good things that AA brought into my Mom’s life to cause her\\xa0ultimately\\xa0to stop\\xa0drinking, but it raises the question, what is a biblical response to addiction? What is a biblical understanding of AA?\\nTo help us address this very important issue, I have invited to the podcast this week, Mark Shaw. Mark is the Executive Director of Vision of Hope and a pastor at Faith Church in Lafayette, Indiana. He is also an ACBC certified counselor and is the author of\\xa0The Heart of Addiction. Mark, we are glad you are with us and as we think through this issue of addiction and AA, the word addiction is really not a word that we find in the Scriptures. How should Christians think biblically about that idea?\\nMark Shaw: I think words are very important and they are like sign posts; they point us in a direction. I think about 1 Corinthians 2:13 that says, “And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.” So with biblical language in regards to\\xa0words like ‘addiction,’ – I use that in my book title – and words like ‘relapse’ and\\xa0‘alcoholism’; I use those words sometimes to help people know what the problem is. Then, when I write about it in my books like\\xa0The Heart of Addiction\\xa0I talk about a biblical, habitual sin nature problem and one of idolatry and of sin rather than as the world characterizes addiction.\\nHeath Lambert: How does the world characterize addiction that is different than what the Bible understands as a habitual sin?\\nMark Shaw: These words are sign posts and so they point people, I think, to a disease outside of themselves; to a problem that is not me, it is not really who I am, it is my disease. It is this thing outside of them rather than recognizing it as their own sinful problem that they need Christ to forgive them of and to begin the transformation process in their own hearts.\\nHeath Lambert: Ok, so if that is what a biblical understanding of addiction is then help us understand Alcoholics Anonymous; what is AA?\\nMark Shaw: AA is a program that started in the 1930’s by a couple of guys; Dr. Bob and Bill Wilson. They started this program and really watered down some biblical teaching and biblical truth; no other way to say it than they just watered it down to make it more appealing to other people. So, you will hear some people who say that there are biblical truths in AA and in the Big Book and that kind of thing, which undoubtedly are true; there are some biblical truths there but they don’t go far enough.\\nFor example, one is that you admit that you are an alcoholic or you admit that you have a problem. Admission is good but confession is what the Bible says we should do. That is admission plus taking it the next step further of confessing it to a holy God that you have sinned against him, that you need Christ’s forgiveness, and that you need this transformation to work in your heart by the Holy Spirit. There are words that they use that are good like ‘admission’ and ‘making amends’ and that kind of thing, but biblical truths are more excellent. Biblical truths point to the whole wisdom of God and so I think half truths in AA can be dangerous for people.\\nHeath Lambert: Ok, so let’s talk about that for a little bit because there are going to be a lot of people listening to this podcast who have had some kind of experience with AA. This is an organization that has effected and\\xa0impacted untold millions of people. I mentioned at the top of the podcast that my mother went to AA for years and years and years. I have been in more AA meetings than I know how to count; ‘Keep coming back, it works.’ ‘It works\\xa0if you work it.’ One day at a time.’ I have been there; I know the stuff. I am thankful, as many who are listening to this are thankful for the good fruit that has come into the lives of people through their interaction with AA. Yet, as biblically minded Christians, we want to have concerns about AA. Why should biblically minded Christians be concerned about AA?\\nMark Shaw: AA sets itself up as a spiritual program. So right there I have a moment of pause; ok this is a spiritual program, but if you read the Big Book and what it teaches the only higher powers that it mentions are like an enlightenment and something other than Jesus. By the very definition of the program it is a higher power of your own choosing, well, that is the very definition of idolatry. If I can choose a higher power then I can make anything my higher power and that is idolatry. Those are super huge concerns from my perspective about being careful to send people to this so called spiritual program that says any god will do; we know there is only one true God.\\nThen when you go to meetings, and you have been, they say things like, ‘We are spiritual people, but those people who go to church, they are religious people.’ ‘We are spiritual they are religious.’ It is characterizing you and I as though we are Pharisees; we are the rule followers without the compassion and love of Christ. That is just unfair. My concern for biblical counselors is when you send people to these programs, don’t assume that this is a Christian program and that the teachings and the writings – the Twelve Traditions, the Twelve Promises, the Twelve Steps – are going to point them to Christ because as I said in the beginning, the words that they choose really point people away from Christ to more of a medical solution and to more of just a worldly, secular mindset. Those are some of the dangers and concerns that I have with the program.\\nHeath Lambert: Many Christians have come to see that there are imperfections and significant problems in AA and so there has been efforts to try to rehabilitate AA with some kind of Christianized version; we think of programs like Celebrate Recovery. Should Christians try to rehabilitate or rescue Alcoholics Anonymous by getting rid of the bad parts and trying to insert some Christian elements into it?\\nMark Shaw: Yeah, I had a friend once tell me, ‘when does a lie ever added to truth make the truth better, and when does the truth ever added to a lie make the lie into pure truth?’ Well, it doesn’t happen. So, I like to start with truth, I like to start with the Scriptures, I like to proclaim the excellencies of Christ and point people to the riches of the Bible. I understand there are well meaning people that are in these programs and they are doing their best and maybe it is all that is out there in their minds. I would rather just start with teaching Scripture, teaching the Word, teaching about idolatry, sin, ruling heart issues and address those matters with these people who struggle with addiction rather than using programs that kinda mix them;\\xa0the worlds teaching with the truth of God’s Word. I don’t think oil and water mix, I don’t think it can be done; it confuses people and it may lead them down the wrong path.\\nHeath Lambert: So I mentioned that my mom went to AA. In my memory as a little boy, I think she started going to AA about the time I was seven and finally was sober for what would turn out to be the rest of her life by the time I was twelve. So it took about five years for the things that were working in AA to be able to take hold. I am very thankful for that. When she went to the last rehab center they all said\\xa0she was at death’s door; she nearly drank herself to death.\\nIt was interesting because from the time I was twelve to the time I was twenty five, my mom was a miserable person. She was what her friends in AA called a dry drunk. She was angry, she was sad, she was promiscuous. She was one of just the nastiest people I have ever met. She was able to keep a job, she was able to keep a roof over her head unlike when she was drinking, but she wasn’t a better person. In fact, me and my brothers use to seriously wish that she would go back to drinking because you could at least live with her. When she wasn’t drunk you couldn’t live with her when she was this way.\\nThe reason I mention that is because what happened when I was twenty-five was I share the gospel with my mother for the umpteenth time, but she believed. She repented of her sins and believe and heart change began to happen. She began to be a qualitatively different person. So for me it was this powerful demonstration – I am thankful for the good things that AA did, but really AA didn’t take my mom very far, it taught her to go to hell more efficiently. It cleaned up her life but she was still going to hell; she was not a changed person. It was the power of Jesus Christ in the Word of God that really brought her the rest of the way. What is it that the Bible adds that is so superior to the Twelve Steps?\\nMark Shaw: Well, the Bible talks about our sin, our need for Christ, and that the transformation process is progressive; that we become like Christ. You know, transformation, we have been transformed in justification, we are being transformed and in sanctification, we will be transformed in glorification and in the AA program, in the Twelve Steps, you won’t hear anything about Jesus Christ, you won’t hear anything about confession of sin. You admit you are wrong but you don’t confess sin; certainly not to a holy God because you are picking a god of your own choosing and of your own understanding. If I choose God then who is really God? It is me; I am in that position of authority. So the Bible gives us lots of biblical truth that moves us and grows us in a deeper way and in an eternal way rather than the Twelve Step program. Which, I agree has some helpful teaching and some things in it that can really help people to be clean and sober, but our goal is not to be clean and sober, our goal is to be like Jesus for God’s glory and that part is missing in the program of Alcoholics Anonymous.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Shaw is ACBC certified since 2002 and serves as the Pastor of Counseling at First Baptist Church of Jacksonville, Florida- Nocatee Campus', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Understanding Addiction', 'subtitle': 'A Moral Problem, Not a Disease', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'It is important that Christians make correct distinctions between medical issues and moral failures.', 'body': 'Throughout my life I have walked with many people down the hard road of addiction. The path is a painful one, and is often a very complicated experience to understand. I was recently reminded of this reality from the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.\\nSecretary Clinton proclaimed on Twitter that, “Addiction is a disease—not a moral failing. We should support those who are struggling with it.” Clinton linked to an article on her campaign website where a great deal of helpful information is related about the quiet epidemic of addiction, and how so many are afflicted with this problem. Clinton is right to be concerned about addiction, and yet her statement is wrong on two counts.\\nFirst, with intense moral clarity Clinton pronounced that addiction is not a moral failing, but a disease. This statement is not true. Christians must make a distinction between moral problems we call sins, and physical problems we call disease. Diseases are problems of physical pathology in the body’s tissue, and are not necessarily connected to any personal moral failings. On the other hand, Christians understand that moral problems are sin, and trace back to the rebellion that exists between God and man, for which we sinners are always held accountable.\\nIt is very important that Christians make correct distinctions between these two categories. If we do not, we will rebuke people who are not responsible for their medical conditions like Parkinson’s disease, or we will seek to offer encouragement and medical care for problems, like sinful anger, that God means to address through the truths in Scripture.\\nClinton does not make a correct distinction in these categories on the issue of addiction. She believes addiction is a disease, but the Bible considers it a moral failing. Consider a few biblical examples as evidence: the drunkenness of addiction is understood to be debauchery, and at odds with a life characterized by the filling of the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 5:18); in the moral list of qualifications for their office deacons are forbidden to be addicted to wine (1 Timothy 3:8); Scripture forbids the greediness of a drunk that demands another drink (Proverbs 23:35); the food addiction of a glutton is understood to be idolatry (Philippians 3:19); and the act of being overcome by a corrupting substance is referred to as spiritual slavery (2 Peter 2:19).\\nPresidential candidates are certainly entitled to their opinion, but Christians have a higher standard to meet when making our own moral declarations. We must submit to God’s Word, and the Bible is clear that addiction is a moral failing. It is a sin against the living God for which people will be judged.\\nI mentioned that Clinton’s statement was wrong on two counts, and her second error is at once more subtle and more dangerous. When the secretary says that, “We should support those who are struggling with it” she assumes that declaring addiction to be sin will be at odds with genuine support and care for addicts. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is at this point that the beauty of God’s Word shines the brightest light on this dark problem. As Christians we know that God has made provision for every sin through the life, death, resurrection, and ascension of his Son, Jesus Christ.\\nChristians know that there is a solution for sin. When we say that addicts are sinners like everyone else, that is the bad news we declare before we pronounce the glorious news that Jesus saves from every sin. If Christians agree with Hillary Clinton that addiction is a disease it will lead us to pursue the sort of secular solutions that have increased the addiction epidemic over the last 50 years. When we agree with God that addiction is a sin, then we can begin to point addicts to the help and hope that comes through Jesus Christ alone.\\n\\nThis column originally appeared in the print edition of the Florida Baptist Witness.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'When Your Adult Child is an Addict', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Tim Brown', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'This article provides practical tips on how parents can minister to their children who are addicted to drugs.', 'body': 'Many years ago my wife and I were devastated by the realization that our son was addicted to drugs. Our Lord used this circumstance in our family to show us that His Word had the answers we were looking for. Second Peter 1:3 says, “His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness…”. God is faithful to His Word and being guided by biblical principles, He convicted our son of his sin and led him to repentance. He also used this circumstance to change our lives as parents and gave us a desire to counsel others.\\nAs the Director of a residential program for men involved with the sin of addiction, I often receive calls from parents seeking advice on what to do with their adult child who is addicted.\\nAs loving parents, you want to do whatever possible to help. It is easy to become frustrated and angry with them as their sin manifests itself in your home. As parents, our expectations for our children are often too high. I’ve found it beneficial to lower our expectations and increase our love. However, you must be cautious because of the manipulative behavior of addicts. They may test you to see if you will give in to their demands for a place to live and means to get by.\\nWhat Can You do to Help Without Being Manipulated by Your Child? \\nKnow that you cannot change his heart. Only the Holy Spirit can through the power of the Word of God. (1 Corinthians 6:11) You must become diligent in your prayers for your loved one. If he is a professing believer that has been caught in the sin of addiction, begin to pray for him to repent from his sin and walk in obedience to our Lord. If he is an unbeliever, pray specifically for his salvation and be diligent in evangelizing him.\\nIn my experience, addicts don’t just wake up one morning and decide to stop using. Think of the times you have heard your adult child who is addicted say, “I promise tomorrow I will stop”. When he is in trouble (with the authorities, their spouse, or employer) he may stop for a short period of time, but soon he is right back at it. That’s how addiction works. It’s likened to Paul’s teaching in Romans 7:19 “For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.” The good the addict desires to do is not get high and not use their substance. But the evil they don’t want to do, the getting high, is what they do. Why is that? Romans 7:20 tells us why, “Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.” Sin is the reason they keep using.\\nAs their parent you must point this out to them, you must be willing to confront them in their sin. In some situations, it may take a devastating event in their life to cause them to see their need for change.\\nOne way you can help them see their need for change is to have a well defined, easy to understand contract. This contract must be non-negotiable and you the parent need to be prepared to ask them to leave your home with the first violation, without exception.\\nThe contract needs to include the following at a minimum:\\nSpiritual Accountability\\nThis will include local church involvement and attending church weekly. The accountability and role of the local church is vital in the transition out of a life of drunkenness into the environment of everyday life. They must be exposed to the preaching of God’s Word. Your loved one is like an athlete who is getting back into sports after a disastrous injury. There will be some time when they will need to wear braces and supports while they build strength back into their muscles and joints. They will need to have in place an accountability network to serve as braces and supports while they continue to strengthen their spiritual muscles. To put it another way, they will need fences to guard them from the full weight of temptation while they continue to grow in Christ (Romans 13:14). So, who is going to be the braces and supports? To be effective, the church must assign those who are willing to become deeply involved in their life. There must be a dedicated accountability partner.\\nMust Work a Full-Time Job\\nBeing idle gives an opportunity for the flesh to seek out drugs and alcohol. You must help them manage their resources. You, together with them, need to develop a budget. The number one area in which former addicts most often fail and fall back into their sin of drunkenness (addiction) is in the area of finances. You must take every precaution to prevent them from making provision for their flesh (Romans 13:14). You must help them cut off the areas that will tempt the flesh – and the thing that seems to most easily to tempt a drunkard (addict) is money. Nearly all of those involved in an addictive life style have completely destroyed their financial standing and many times ruined the financial standing of their families. They must give full disclosure and have limited or no access to funds for at least one year. This means they will operate on a strict cash allowance system, with no direct access to a checking account or any other liquid assets.\\nWillingly Submit to Random Drug testing, Agree to be Home at Specific Times, Choose Friends Wisely (1 Corinthians 15:33)\\nThese are a few suggestions that you can implement into the life of your child. Their change process of becoming more like Christ requires you to speak the truth of God’s Word in love to them. Ephesians 4:15 “Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,” Be patient with them. But never compromise the truth of God’s Word. 2 Thessalonians 3:13-15 “As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good. \\xa0If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed. \\xa0Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.”\\nFor a more comprehensive study on this topic read “Divine Intervention, Hope And Help For Families Of Addicts” By Mark Shaw.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTim Brown is the Executive Director of His Steps Ministries and is married to Kit.

      "{'title': 'A Journey Out Of Anorexia', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 6', 'author': 'Heath Lambert  Rebecca Maketansky', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Addiction & Bondage 14', 'question': 'Rebecca Maketansky shares her journey with anorexia, including the steps she took to turn from her sin and trust Jesus to change her.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: Anorexia is a deadly problem, with some studies indicating that as many as ten percent of people who struggle with it will lose their lives. This is a very significant issue that Christians must know how to respond to, and to help us think about it, I have asked Rebecca Maketansky to join us on the podcast today. Rebecca is a graduate of the biblical counseling program at Boise College, and she serves the Association of Certified Biblical counselors at our headquarters here in Louisville. Rebecca, as a young girl, you struggled with the problem of anorexia. Rebecca, I would like for you to share with our listeners what your struggle looked like.\\nRebecca Maketansky: Yeah, I began in eighth grade when I wanted to lose weight, and I wanted to lose weight because there was a particular girl on a television show that I wanted to look like. I saw her, and I determined in my heart that I wanted to be her size by ninth grade. So I started dieting and exercising toward that end, and I began to lose weight. But what happened to me was I kept lowering my weight goal, and the target kept shifting; my methods became more drastic to achieve that goal. I went from dieting and exercising, which are good things, to bad things, like not eating enough food and spitting out food after tasting it so as not to swallow it. I began exercising on top of exercising and going to bed hungry so that I would wake up with a smaller waistline in the morning. And so, that’s what my struggle began to look like.\\nHeath Lambert: One of the most seriously concerning realities about anorexia is that the person with the struggle does not perceive that they have a struggle at all. They think the struggle is with the family members and friends who were talking to them. And so it can be very challenging to get the lights to come on in the heart of someone who has this problem. Tell us what happened in your life so that you began to understand that I have a real problem here.\\nRebecca Maketansky: I began to see that I had a real physical problem when I began experiencing chest pains. And I didn’t tell anyone; I was afraid to. But I started realizing that something wrong and scary was going on. I realized it was a spiritual problem when my older sister Corrie Ann challenged me one day—I’ll never forget the conversation—she said to me, “I want you to know that what you are doing is sin. And now that you know that it’s sin, I want you to know that believers do not choose to continue to live in sin.” And that was when the lights came on in my heart. I was a follower of Christ, I hadn’t seen it as a spiritual problem until then, but when she said that, I realized that I had to choose to follow Christ, which led away from the lifestyle I had built.\\nHeath Lambert: I want to ask you about that because we sometimes operate in a Christian culture that doesn’t see pointing out sin as a good thing. Sometimes we look at somebody like yourself as a young girl who was struggling with a serious and dangerous sin, and we’re worried that if we extend a rebuke of sin, we’re going to somehow make it worse. But you didn’t receive that rebuke as harsh from your sister who loved you. You received it as a gracious and hopeful thing. So, talk to us about how you received your sister’s rebuke.\\nRebecca Maketansky: I received it in love because it was given in love. I knew my sister, and I knew she loved me. It was also received in love because she was trying to restore my relationship with Jesus. She was trying to salvage that which I was destroying. I received it in love because it was pointing me to Christ and not just camping out on my sin.\\nHeath Lambert: After that initial conversation where you became aware that you needed to respond with greater faith and confidence in the Lord Jesus Christ in how you were eating, there was a process that ensued. So help us understand some of the change processes that followed that conversation. In particular, what were some of the key turning points that led you to be able to get into a different spot?\\nRebecca Maketansky: The key turning points in my struggle with anorexia started with the conversation with my sister pointing me to Christ and away from my sin. That led to my wrestling with the Lord in prayer and telling Jesus that I wanted to change, I wanted to follow him, I wanted to let go of my sin, but I needed His help. And then that led to a conversation with my sister where we sat down together with a notepad, and she helped me write up guidelines for myself each day for the process of change. That notebook had things in it like you had to eat a certain amount of food each day, you had a limit on your daily exercise, and so that was very helpful when I would get in moments of temptation or get in moments of worry that I was gaining weight. Those were helpful, tangible realities that kept me on the road to change.\\nHeath Lambert: And how long did that take? I mean, you were in the eighth grade when you started to develop a problem. How long until you would say that I was really out of the woods and in a different spot?\\nRebecca Maketansky: Yeah. The process of change was a long one. My sister was a very persistent counselor. I think it probably took maybe a year and a half for me to get out of the woods to a safer place. Perhaps longer than that before I quit needing occasional check-ins. There were lots of things that needed to change. I had to change the way I thought about food. There are a lot of things that the Lord had to change. He had to change my desires, He had to change my outlook on myself, and He had to change my motivation for gaining weight. He had a lot of work to do, so it was maybe about a year and a half.\\nHeath Lambert: And what about now? What is your attitude about food and healthy eating now versus what it was back when you were facing this struggle?\\nRebecca Maketansky: Yeah, thankfully, the Lord has changed me a lot and given me whole new desires and perspectives. I even remember coming out of the struggle, and in the walk of repentance, the Lord replaced desires to be the skinniest in the room with desires to be a healthy weight and to be an example to other girls that may have been struggling like me. And desires to steward my body well so that I was healthy and able to serve the Lord in a greater capacity than I was before. And another thing that the Lord has taught me is to be thankful for food. You know, when I was struggling with anorexia, food was my obsession, but it was also my enemy, and now, the Lord has changed that to food is a gift from the Lord that we steward well for His glory and that we are thankful for it each meal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nAddiction & Bondage\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRebecca Maketansky serves alongside her husband Dan at Holland Church in Holland, MA.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Unique Challenges in Counseling the Disordered Eater', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Cheryl Szarko', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': \"Instead of reflecting the culture's ideas of diet and health, biblical counselors can offer hope and freedom grounded in the gospel.\", 'body': 'Counseling always presents challenges, but those involving disordered eating pose unique difficulties for biblical counselors.\\nDefining Disordered Eating\\nDisordered eating includes more than just diagnosed eating disorders. It encompasses chronic dieting, weight cycling, preoccupation with food, obsessive calorie counting, unhealthy body image, restrictive diets, and unnatural attempts to achieve a specific body size.\\nIn today’s culture, these behaviors are often normalized, even praised. However, they can profoundly disrupt a person’s relationship with food, their body, and God—often without the individual recognizing the problem.\\nLet’s explore some unique challenges biblical counselors face when working with those struggling with disordered eating.\\nChallenge #1: Disordered Eating is Not Recognized as a Problem\\nOne significant challenge is that disordered eating is rarely recognized as problematic. Cultural norms have made these behaviors seem acceptable, making it difficult for individuals to see the need for change. Christians may even equate these restrictive practices with righteousness before God. They need the truth of passages like Mark 7:18-23.\\nDisordered eaters rarely seek counseling explicitly for issues with food or body image. They may simply consider these issues a normal part of adult life. Instead, they often present with symptoms of anxiety, depression, or spiritual struggles without realizing that these are connected to deeper heart issues that require the light of Christ and His gospel of grace.\\nUnlike more obvious spiritual struggles, disordered eating doesn’t initially appear to be a biblical concern. Understanding these issues through God’s Word takes significant effort by both counselor and counselee.\\nMoreover, cultural praise for thinness and restrictive eating can make disordered eating feel like a willpower issue rather than a heart problem that requires spiritual transformation (Colossians 2:20-23). The resulting guilt and shame often lead individuals to manage their struggles in isolation, avoiding discussions about food and weight with their counselor.\\nChallenge #2: The Relentless Influence of Diet Culture\\nWe live in a society saturated with diet culture, where harmful messages about food and body image often go unnoticed, much like background noise. Diet and “health” messages have been the zeitgeist of the past 40 years.\\nBecause diet culture’s messages do not seem overtly anti-biblical, they are readily accepted without scrutiny (Colossians 2:8). These messages often claim to promote health, which is widely regarded as a virtuous pursuit, but they mask an idolization of the body, self, and approval of others that can be spiritually dangerous.\\nDiet culture promotes weight loss as a top priority, often regardless of health, and encourages fad diets over sustainable practices. It promotes incorrect nutrition information, assumes that thinness equals health, and moralizes body size. It glorifies the pursuit of health beyond responsible stewardship, creating an unhealthy preoccupation with appearance, control, and perfectionism. This mindset leads to guilt over non-sinful actions, like enjoying a meal or missing a workout (Matthew 6:31-33).\\nFor disordered eaters, recognizing the influence of diet culture can be a slow process. Unraveling these beliefs takes time, as they often seem harmless. Understanding diet culture’s impact is crucial for reclaiming a biblical view of food and body.\\nChallenge #3: Lack of Support for Edification\\nA third challenge is the potential lack of support from the church community. Ideally, Christian counseling should encourage greater involvement in the local church for ongoing support and accountability.\\nAs counselors, we recognize that the local fellowship and eldership best provide the needed encouragement, accountability, support, and edification for continued growth. However, many church members may be just as entangled in disordered eating beliefs, unknowingly reinforcing harmful practices rather than helping to correct them (Romans 14:13).\\nThe church can sometimes promote the same messages as the broader culture, assigning moral imperatives to weight loss, food elimination plans, and “clean eating.” There’s an unspoken rule that “healthiness is next to godliness,” overshadowing true sanctification.\\nAs counselors, we must be prepared to navigate these waters, helping counselees understand that striving for health is not the same as being consumed by appearance, food, or a constant focus on dieting. Even the pursuit of health can become an idol masquerading as noble. Yet, true body stewardship is ultimately for serving our great God, and Christian self-discipline is not aimed at fitting worldly beauty standards or gaining the approval of others.\\nReclaiming a biblical view of eating and health means recognizing the dangers inherent in imposing moral value on food and fitness beyond what God has said (1 Corinthians 10:30). Instead, we have been freed to honor God with our bodies and minds through a thankful, grace-filled gospel approach.\\nChallenge #4: Counselor Bias and Self-Examination\\nFinally, it’s crucial for counselors to examine their own biases regarding food, body image, and health. Living in a diet-obsessed culture means the question we should ask ourselves is not, “Have I been affected by the diet culture?” but “In what ways have I been affected by it?”\\nYou can do future counselees a great service by recognizing your own answers to the following questions (Matthew 7:3-4): Have I adopted beliefs that thinness equates to morality? Do I find myself admiring those who adhere strictly to health and fitness practices? Am I tempted to see disordered eating as merely a physical problem rather than a spiritual one? Do I assume those in larger bodies are lazy, lack willpower, or don’t care to honor God?\\nWe must be careful to apply the gospel to counselees who are struggling with disordered eating, guiding them to see their true value and identity in Christ (Galatians 2:20) rather than in their body size or eating habits. But you must first believe this is true.\\nIt’s not enough to help counselees stop harmful behaviors and try new health habits; we must first help them cultivate a biblical mindset about food, eating, and their body. This requires us to be vigilant against our own susceptibility to diet culture and prioritize spiritual growth over physical benefits, including the pursuit of “health,” which is a temporal goal.\\nConclusion\\nCounseling the disordered eater requires great compassion, patience, discernment, and commitment to biblical truth. The challenges are many: the cultural normalization of disordered eating, the subtle but pervasive influence of diet culture, a potential lack of a supportive Christian community, and even our own biases.\\nHowever, with God’s guidance, we can compassionately help counselees see beneath the surface and address the heart issues that drive their struggles (1 Thessalonians 5:14). As we bring biblical truth to bear on these deeply ingrained beliefs, we can help disordered eaters find freedom in Christ and learn to honor God with their whole selves (1 Corinthians 10:31).\\nLet us continue to prayerfully engage with these issues, challenging such assumptions, educating our churches, supporting the suffering, and holding fast to the hope we have in Christ.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCheryl Szarko is a\\xa0registered\\xa0dietitian\\xa0nutritionist and certified biblical counselor.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

She serves as the executive administrative assistant to the provost at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, in Louisville, Kentucky. She’s also an adjunct instructor of biblical counseling at Boise college. She received a Master of Divinity from Southern Seminary and has been counseling and discipling women for over 13 years. She has been certified with ACBC since 2011 and prior to coming to Louisville, she served as a missionary to an unreached people group in Central Asia, for nearly five years. Hannah, I’m so grateful for you. Thank you for your work there at Southern Seminary and even from our discussion last week talking about eating disorders. I think it’d be important for us to continue some of that conversation. So, thank you for coming back and being with us today.\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Yes, I’m so glad to be.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Last time we were talking a little bit about issues related to eating. I love the way that you frame it. You started with the idea: What does God give us as the purpose for eating? We don’t just start with the problem and try to understand the problem itself. We start with what God intended for eating—that we’re to eat to His glory. We are to eat for the sake of nourishment. We see provision that He’s given us through this process of eating, but then we see where that purpose is not used in a proper way. And we see the manifestation of sin in our hearts, in the ways that we eat, and in the consequences that ensue. And so, we can observe those problems within the framework of what God designed. And then, you went into a little bit about sort of a first session. Okay, so we don’t get overwhelmed as counselors, how do we approach situations like this, because there’s so much to think about? And you describe two different ways to triage what’s going on, the level of care and what needs to happen? Do we need to give referrals to physicians? All that good stuff is really important. You talked a lot about the variables and knowing this particular individual who sitting across the table. I think that’s one of the most valuable pieces, as you get to know them and build rapport with them, but you’re knowing this particular individual, not just seeing them as the problem of eating disorders. You’re seeing them as an individual and what they’re struggling with. And all the variables that built, what brought them into the room. Specifically, we want to pick up there. Okay, we see the manifestation of eating disorders in lots of ways. We can talk about obesity, or you can talk about what we consider to be, sort of, classic cases of anorexia and bulimia. But how do we as counselors get to the root of the problem? How do we dive down deep to find out, “Okay, what is behind this?” What are areas that are particularly important that you see to probe and evaluate the specific problem in this person, to find the root issues going on.\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Over my years of counseling, I’ve learned about seven views that I really want to hone in on. I want to understand first their view of God. Do they even believe in Him? Where are they with Him and their relationship? Yeah, and just understanding from that angle. I also want to know what their home life is like. Has there been any loss in their home life? Have there been arguments or conflicts with their parents, that has maybe, for a teenager, kind of brought tension in their life and they’re internalizing a lot. Or is their home life great, and everything. I also want to understand their view of friends and friendships. Are they being bullied? Or are they in a good friend group? Do they have friends that encourage them or friends that maybe tear them down? What do they consider as a friend? And are they getting advice from a friend that may not be good? Just kind of understanding that whole angle. Also, just life in reality, are things in their life kind of constantly chaotic? Are they living kind of not wanting to face or accept some things in their life—any major crises that have been happening lately or in the past that maybe they’ve never dealt? With just kind of understanding that whole angle and how they view life in itself. Also, another view that I really want to deal with is food. You know, do they deny food? Do they see it as a gift from the Lord? Are there particular foods that are bad to them, that they only see calories and only see weight gain? Or are they like looking at a spectrum of food and that they’re thankful and seeking to serve and love the Lord with that food. Or are they using food to kind of maybe get what they want? Or restricting food in order to get the thinness and so forth? Another category is self—just kind of looking at body image. What type do they think their body is? Some of these questions I may ask from a different angle. I don’t want to put thoughts in their head, but I do want to find out kind of: What do they see? How do they see themselves? Had they heard someone else talk about them in a certain way, and maybe that’s played in their law and their thoughts? But yet, all of those areas are really important to gain a better understanding, and not just presume that you’re thinking the same way that they are, or that they are thinking the same way as God’s word teaches us. And lastly, authority. I feel like this is bigger, more so than before. But yeah, as a sense of authority, do they see the doctors as helpful? Or do they see themselves as the authority figure? They know the right weight that they’re supposed to be at. They know what is best. Are they loving and obedient to their parents and the help that they’re getting from their parents? Or are they kind of very standoffish to their parents, and so forth? And really gaining an understanding of those horizontal relationships will also help me understand where they see God as their authority, vertically.\\xa0\\nAnd if those things are out of place, then we can understand they’re at the center and so forth. And a lot of these, you know, disorders and problems kind of persist when several of these views are out of place. Again, in thinking through all these different views, I’ve just found them really helpful, because it gives me an idea of really where they’re struggling and maybe helps me to understand their perspective more. Most people that are struggling with eating are not necessarily doing it just out of spite. It started from thinking and believing, and so you just kind of want to start to peel it back like an onion and get to their heart attitude and their posture before the Lord.\\xa0I counseled some recently, just in a sense of learning: Do they accept instruction, or do they not? Proverbs 15:31 is very clear that whoever does not accept instruction will face misery, and not prosper. And so, I think we see that all through Scripture with Israel and Judah. And God warns us when we don’t accept instruction, and we don’t listen to God. That’s why He pleads for us, even in Deuteronomy, “Hear, O Israel, I am the Lord your God.” So, we really want to hear from the counselee, but also hear from God’s Word, so that we can engage with the counselee and help correct the things that we’re seeing that are not seen from God’s perspective, in a sense.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I love those categories, and anytime we can frame categories like this, it really helps us to think more clearly. And I think what you’ve done here is really helpful for us who engage in this type of counseling on a regular basis. I would encourage our listeners maybe to pause, go back, and listen to some of those particulars. It is helpful in lots of different counseling cases, but particularly as it relates to things like eating disorders. The last thing that you mentioned, Hannah, I think is really a brilliant way to approach this. You’re seeing a phenomenon that’s sort of specific to the culture in which we live right now. This issue of sort of rebelling against authority to some degree. Whether it’s, you know, “I don’t need to listen to the physician, he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I can do my own caloric intake, and I can sort this out. And I know what’s best for me.” you know, some of that has to do with the separation of generations. Now, we have had those types of problems in the past, but now we have the internet and Google. And Google, or really AI now, becomes really their authority, where we can just find out anything about anything, and I can sort of drive this ship. And man, we’re seeing tons of deception happen. And again, the passage that you mentioned in Proverbs, where it sort of dulls them toward hearing instruction and the Bible warns that that’s a dangerous thing, so it is a really interesting phenomena that you brought up there. I think it’s something for our counselors to make sure that we’re paying attention to and that we don’t gloss over. Now any time that we’re dealing with cases like this, we’re always trying to think, “Well, you know, counseling in and of itself can be very helpful, but it’s not necessarily the end all; we need more. This is a problem that they’ve had in living, and we’re not going to fix this in one hour, you know, in a week or even a series of weeks.” We’re going to be helpful, but we need some other resources. I want you to talk a little bit about maybe what some of those other resources might be, that you would advise for the counselee as they deal with this eating disorder.\\n\\u200bHannah Carter:\\xa0\\u200bSure, yeah. So, as you’re helping someone through their eating problem, we want to just balance things physically and spiritually, not just take one over the other. And in doing so, it’s helpful to have a nutritionist or a doctor, certain follow-ups that they’re having, so that they can gain an understanding of: What is good to eat? What does my body need? Because all of our body types are different. If there’s a teenager, and they’re in a growing phase, you want to make sure that they’re having enough of certain minerals, or milk, and all the kinds of things that our bodies need. Also, you cannot do this alone, you need the body of Christ. If it’s a roommate, you need other roommates to surround this person as well as the counselor, and as well as someone from the church. If parents are dealing with a teenager, you can’t do this alone. You need another parent to help you, to encourage you. You need someone in your church to come alongside and try to start bridging the gaps between the person that’s struggling with food to maybe a close friend. That is wise and so that they can have a peer kind of help come alongside them. That is the biggest thing because they didn’t get here overnight, and they’re not going to get out of this overnight. And so, it’s going to take a while to be able to walk through this. And so, you need help, so that you don’t wear out, and you don’t get weary.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, very good. And I think that detail—accountability, where you incorporate other people who are walking with them in normal daily tasks. Eating is something that, as we mentioned before, is a mundane thing that we do that is a part of our daily routine. And if we’re enticed to be deceived in those mundane things, we need people around us to help to hold us accountable at those different really important junctures, throughout the rhythm of a day. And that’s pretty important. One of the other things that you mentioned that I think is really worth highlighting is, of course, we would refer to physicians to help us here to evaluate: What’s the effect on the body? How bad is this, their weight? Are they at a very unhealthy place? And they can help us with a plan.\\xa0 Are we seeing consequences that can be damaging to the body, even long term—especially if they’re binging and purging, and that sort of thing? But you mentioned a nutritionist. I’ve found personally that nutritionists are some of the most helpful people when dealing with these types of issues, particularly with young ladies. One of the things that I found is that a nutritionist has a distinct way of getting caloric intake, in a way that’s not so offensive to someone who is afraid of eating certain things. And where, as you mentioned, you know, they need a certain level of nutrition. Maybe certain minerals and vitamins and that sort of thing. A nutritionist has a way of building that caloric intake over a day’s time, over a week’s time, and presenting it in a way that’s very helpful to the individual. And I found their work in this process is as helpful as any, especially if they’ve built up a long-term pattern of not eating healthy or misappropriating the way that they think about eating. A nutritionist can be very, very helpful here in getting us the right things without it being so overwhelming, because to that young girl’s mind often like, “You mean to tell me I need a plate that looks like my Thanksgiving plate at every meal, and that’s how I’m going to put on weight?” And nutritionists can really help her to think through that in a way to eat healthy, but to eat good. And that way, it’s helping her to maintain a weight. So, I would encourage what you said there, relative to the nutritionist. This is very, very helpful, as always. And these issues, you sort of alluded to it on the last answer that you gave, Hannah. Relative to some of the problems that we need to pay attention to, some of the obstacles, and the pitfalls as in any counseling case—we need to pay attention to that. We need to be aware of our own limitations, our own frailties, and our own blindness as counselors. But even more so, when we’re talking about issues that can have, you know, very strong consequences like something relative to an eating disorder. So, talk a little bit about some of the obstacles that we need to be paying attention to and be aware of as counselors who are engaging on this level.\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Yeah. So, one of them is maybe not getting enough information. If you don’t have enough in the beginning, later on you’ll start to see some of that. If there’s kind of becoming a wall that’s coming up between you and your counselee, I would just be asking more questions. You know, how are they doing? What’s going on? What attitude have they had this week or how has their eating been, when you get food logs, and so forth, back—Just to make sure that they’re not hiding from you, or they’re being clear. But yeah, just being aware of them, of their mannerisms, and of their attitude, because that can point to something. And you want to make sure that you can see those things. The other thing is sometimes we can move, as we said previously, too quickly. We can want them to start eating, right? Just so that maybe the parent feels better, or the doctor feels better. And then, they can start cooperating with you just to check off the box, but they’re not doing it from a heart that desires it. And so, you want them to be fully on board in that way and move with you in that change and in that growth. My mom is a master gardener, and she’s taught me a lot about plants and different things. And one thing is that during the winter, she’ll take a cutting from a big healthy plant and replant it and allow it to start growing and provide roots. Well, when I was home recently, one of the cuttings was little and young, but it was already starting to bloom, and she plucked off the bloom. And I thought, “Oh wasn’t that going to be pretty?” And she was like, “Well no, it actually needs to use all of its strength to make healthy root systems. If it blooms, it will use the strength on the bloom instead of the strength to put down roots.” And so, as I was thinking about that. She was explaining that when plants are stressed, they will try to start blooming and provide seeds so that they can reproduce. And one of the things that hit me is with counseling. There is a sense of we want to see change. None of\\xa0us want to be in the circumstance we are in. But we don’t want to go so quickly that we only see the bloom and there’s no root when drought comes. And it made me think of Psalm 1 and Jeremiah 17 where it tells us that we want to plant ourselves near the stream of water. A tree that’s planted by the stream of water will have the roots when the drought comes and not be anxious about it, because we’re steady and we’re firm. And so that’s what we want to do as counselors when we’re helping someone with an eating disorder or also honestly any type of problem. We want to see the fruit, but not aim for it too quickly and not get their hopes up, but also encourage them. It’s going to be a slow process. It’s not wrong to see green, it’s not wrong to see just a plant. The root is actually underneath, and it is gaining nourishment as we’re growing, and so that change may be slow, but it can be very steady and could be very helpful when times are rough. So, that’s just something that I’ve learned. And I’ve thought about this that as counselors we can want this so badly or even counselees want to change so badly and be tired of the circumstances they are in. But pruning, as Jesus teaches us in His word, is not bad. It’s good. We need to be okay with that. We need to see that as Him growing us more and more into His likeness.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, and I think places just like you know dealing with eating disorders. We have a tendency that we want to see behavior so bad, that’s sort of like the bloom. We want to see those behaviors so bad that we forget the root system. And I mean, I think well said relative to paying attention to obstacles. Listen, the way that we overcome obstacles is that we have to first acknowledge that they exist. And then start to identify, what are some of those particular things that we see as common trends with folks who deal with these types of issues of sin, rooted in their heart. And then we can start to overcome those and pay attention to those pitfalls and help to move a person forward. But as you said, slow and steady wins the race with helping them to grow deep roots. We want to see long-term faithfulness and we want to see them change for the glory of God. And their life will be radically different. This has been really great, Hannah. I really appreciate the time and some of your Insight. The Lord is using you to work with some young ladies and just as you have been growing and learning from that and helping to teach us what you’ve learned from the Word, I appreciate that.\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Thank you.

She serves as the executive administrative assistant to the provost at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, and as an adjunct instructor of biblical counseling at Boise College in Louisville, Kentucky. She received a Master of Divinity from Southern Seminary and has been counseling and discipling women for over thirteen years. Hannah has been a certified member of ACBC since 2011. Prior to coming to Louisville, Kentucky, she served as a missionary to an unreached people group in Central Asia for nearly five years. Hannah, it is so good to have you on the podcast today and to talk about a really tough topic. And so, I’m looking forward to the discussion. So, welcome to the podcast.\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Thank you. It’s great to be here today, thanks.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now we’re talking about this issue of eating disorders. And this is certainly a problem, and it seems to have a cycle where it grows in popularity or dominance within a culture, and then it sort of takes a backseat to maybe other issues, and then it comes out again. We see this obviously a lot with young teen girls, but it’s not exclusive to young teen girls. So, we want to approach this today, if we can. The Bible speaks a lot about eating in and of itself, and so the Bible is not blinded to how we should think about eating and how we should approach this issue of eating. I want to start with maybe describing a little bit about what the Bible describes relative to eating: How we are called to eat? What’s our purpose in eating? What are some of the things that can go wrong, even as we think about that purpose that God has given us in the Word?\\xa0\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Yeah. So, as we think about different passages in Scripture, in 1 Corinthians 10 and then in 2 Timothy, we learn that God calls us to eat for His glory. But we also eat because we need nourishment, and He’s provided those essential nutrients on Earth for us to have. It also expresses that we are dependent people. We are dependent on food and God has provided us food, so that we can be sustained and have strength—not only to just live, but to serve His church and His kingdom. And so food is really important. God also calls us to eat in moderation and to hold closely to just taking pleasure in the good things that He’s given us.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Man, I love that. I love the way you frame it. First, we have to talk about, you know, what I call a theological idea. We start with what God intends for a given thing, like food. And food in and of itself is a good thing. He’s given it to us to sustain ourselves. There’s not a whole lot more mundane thing that we do, maybe rather than walking, sleeping, or breathing, that we do besides eating. Eating is very mundane, yet the Scriptures tell us that we’re to eat to the glory of God. We’re to give ourselves in seeking nourishment and eating, for the glory of the Lord. And if we think about it, the way you just framed it, we’re not starting with the problem itself, we’re starting with God’s purpose of it. And that really helps us to frame what we can see going wrong, when we don’t glorify God in our eating. So, I want you to start talking about what are some of the particular things that go wrong when we’re not eating for the glory of God, or not eating for the purpose of nourishment. We’re not self-controlled in our eating. A lot of people, obviously, think about anorexia or bulimia, but we also have the issue of obesity. So, we got problems on both ends of the spectrum here. So, I want you to explore some of these things that can go wrong when we don’t think about eating to the glory of God.\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Yes. So, food, like many other things in our life, can be used as a vehicle to sort out problems of life. We can either turn to it, or we turn away from it to deal with pressures and difficulties. And when we’re not eating as God has called us to in an ordered way, it becomes disordered. We’re disordered in thinking we need to have a certain appearance, or we need to restrict certain foods, or we need to eat enough to be comforted. And so, that’s when you start seeing the overly restrictive type-eating which our culture deems as anorexia. And then, you have others that are unrestrained eating, which is more bulimia, or binge-eating, kind of gluttony-type eating disorders. Again, these are disordered ways of eating, but it’s not a disease per se. It is a disordered way of thinking about yourself, thinking about food, thinking about God and His provision. And so, therefore, as we’re trying to deal from our heart, with all problems in the world, we are looking at food in particular, in the way we’re taking it in, or needing to control, and so forth. And it can get difficult. And so that’s why we’re seeing all these common problems. And actually, since COVID, I think there’s been an uptick in a lot of what I’m seeing and hearing from the teenage side, and so forth, struggling in this area.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, I like the way you frame it to describe these problems as disorders, and we would say—yes, there are disorders in the patterns of our eating and the choices that we make relative to eating, and certainly the consequences that has. But in order to understand something as a disorder, we have to have an orderly way of thinking, and that’s why we framed it the way that we did, right? So, we start with God’s order, process, and purpose for eating. And then, we think about it in terms of now, we can frame what we see as being disorders from that. The reason that’s important—and I want our listeners to pay attention to how Hannah’s framing is—The reason that’s critical is because you will miss-associate the problem, if you start there. You will miss-define the problem, if you start there. You have to frame it first in: What does God say is orderly? Okay, now let’s consider what we can see and observe with our eyes as being a disorder, of how we should approach this issue of eating. But you mentioned that there are common problems. And we talked about the spectrum of what that could look like in the lack of self-control or being unbelievably controlled and, you know, not eating for the purpose of nourishment. We can see all kinds of health effect that come with those types of things. But there are some common denominators here, Hannah. So, what I want you to do is help us to see what are some of those things that these types of sinful responses to eating have in common?\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Yeah, so with those struggling with—and I’ll just use the familiar terms—the anorexia, or bulimia and binge-eating are all having a common understanding of needing to control their food or weight. There’s also another common denominator of just taking extreme measures to control that weight. Sometimes it’s obsessing over-exercise, because they know they need to eat, or they’re being told to eat, but they don’t want to keep that weight on. And then for bulimia, they’ll eat a lot but then in order to control it, they’ll purge. And then, also with these different eating disorders, there are complicating factors. Some will turn to cutting as another way of releasing difficulties in their life. Some will also maybe take some medication. And all of them have been struggling with fear, that I’ve counseled. And so there are multiple things that also complicate, not just the physical eating part of what’s going on in all that. And again, there’s a common skewed view about themselves, about food, about portions, about their body, and even about God, and how He is and their relationship with Him. Or if they don’t have a relationship with Him, then in their own understanding of who He is, in the mist of all that.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, well said. I think, you know, the commonality that we see here is it points to the story the Bible describes—Which is that there are roots of sin and desire on the inside. But then, they manifest themselves in a lot of different ways, like where we were talking about the lack of self-control in the aspect of obesity. Or you know, the overindulgence in self-control, trying to control every aspect, relative to exercise, intake, and that sort of thing. Now, some of this can sound overwhelming to people, right? You described some complicating factors. You described a little bit about some of the consequences relative to a person’s health. And often times we may not find out about these eating disorders until there are some sort of visible consequences that are happening. So, this can be scary to people when they see a need, and they want to help, but they’re hearing all these things. They don’t know what to do. But where do we begin, when we approach someone who’s struggling with issues like this? And listen, I don’t want to make too much of, “Oh, this is so hard on the counselor”, what this person is going through. Their life (of the counselee) is really, really difficult. But there are some things that we as counselors need to sort out in order to help them. Well, so how do you start counseling when someone who comes to you with, with these types of issues with eating?\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Usually, I’ll have a form that they’ve completed and it gives me some information. And so if I’ve noticed that’s been a struggle in the past or currently a struggle, I will honestly treat it like no other counselee. I will treat them the same. In a sense of, I’m still gathering all the information that I can from the past, present, future, and ongoing things that they’re dealing with. I’m really trying to grasp an understanding of their perspective on what’s going on, how they kind of got there, different things in their life that had kind of maybe contributed to where they’re at. I’m learning also, how they’re interpreting things. Again, I’m not giving counsel just yet. I’m really grabbing all that I can from them. Because what I’m doing is showing compassion. I’m showing that I want to gain their trust. I’m showing that I don’t know them well, and I need to know them well in order to give them help. And so, again, I’m not coming with a presumption, but really hearing them, because with every person that I’ve counseled, this particular problem has been different. They’ve come from different angles. They’ve come from different paths. And so, therefore, their thoughts, and their beliefs about those things are different, and you want to help individually with those things.\\nAgain, just thinking through, in showing compassion and care, I’m remembering that it is difficult at times. I think even parents and friends that may relate with this counselee in particular maybe get angry in dealing with a problem like eating and being restrictive. Or there’s a shame there, there’s a stubbornness, there’s resistant to hear truth, there’s fear—I’m trying to draw it all out, as Proverbs says, “A man of understanding will draw another person out.” And so I’m trying to get it out, but also not respond in anger or stubbornness back, but really trying to be patient with them. Another big thing that I also try to learn is what immediate thing needs to be dealt with. So, in a sense: Are they seeing a doctor right now? Or where are they at with their weight? Are they kind of on the edge? Or have they just come from a treatment facility? Or do they need to go to the hospital? Like there are all kinds of ranges, and you want to know what’s going on there, in order to really help from that, if they’re cutting, along with some of those things. Again, I’m going to deal with that as I see with wisdom and so forth. If it’s very serious, you never want to play around with it. And you do, we do need to utilize the hospital and doctors in this area, and your area to help with that.\\xa0\\nBut the next thing, I’ll also do is try to listen to their heart, try to understand their thoughts and beliefs going on. So you’re getting a doctor. You’re helping from the physical side, but you’re also trying to get down to the heart. A lot of times I will hear from someone struggling that they’re just wanting control, but I don’t just take it out what they’re saying at face value, because often control has different forms there. And so, I’ll ask them all: What would the control give you? Why is that so important to you? Sometimes counselees are coming from a difficult background in their life, or in their home life there are difficult things going on, and so they’re just alone. They’re wanting to be loved. They’re wanting to be seen. And so maybe they’re wanting love in a deeper way. And so on the outside, it looks like control. So therefore, they’re not necessarily just wanting control, they’re using control to get to being loved and to belong. Yeah, so you just want to kind of break those things down for them, to help them to see that.\\nAnd lastly, you’re giving them hope—you cannot do this enough. The Lord God is the God of all hope. And so we need to repeatedly and consistently teach the counselees that are dealing with eating to have hope, and help them know that change is possible. So, I’ll at some point in our counseling time talk through: What does that look like? And really get very specific there, because ultimately I’m not just trying to help them learn how to eat better and eat for the glory of God. I want them to have a deep relationship with the Lord, and that’s what my end goal is: That they will not just live for the Lord, but live with Him, and know Him, and treasure Him above all things.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, I love that, Hannah. And we’re running a little low on time, but I want to highlight several things that you said in this last answer, and I want to ask you to come back. I think it will be good for us to continue this discussion because obviously, there’s a whole lot to say in this particular area. I really appreciate the way that you nuance on some of this in the final answer that you gave. I want to highlight three particular things that I think were really important. The first thing is the pace—sometimes we need to slow down, and you’re gathering information. There’s very important information. I describe this to my students sort of similar to what you were doing. Although you have a blanket issue like an eating disorder, anxiety, or whatever the case might be—every person that walks in the door that has that particular issue, it’s not exactly the same. It never presents exactly the same. Yes, underlying issues are very similar, but each person presents distinct variables that brought them to this particular place, at this particular time. And when you’re generic in the way that you understand something, in how you gather data, and how you understand the person, then you’re going to give generic counsel. And that will rarely be received well. So, if we can understand the variables, Then I’m using the language that’s very appropriate to their life. And I’m taking very appropriate passages and applying that to the language that has built the variables in their life, that’s brought them into the room at this particular time. That’s a critical step, and I think you explain that part very, very well.\\xa0\\nThe other thing that I would mention is the way you described triage. You’re triaging to say, “okay, like what brought them to me today? Did they just come out of a treatment facility?” Well, okay, I need to approach them in sort of maintenance, ‘Let’s make sure that we’re moving in a good direction’ way. Maybe, as I’ve had encounters with young ladies, they were brought to me by referral from a physician who is very concerned about where they were. And we were sort of in an emergency type state. We needed to get help very very quickly. And what are we going to do here? So you need to triage to see: Where are they? What’s appropriate right now? We can talk about a long-term plan, but you have to triage, sort of, where they are: What are the presenting factors? What does their health look? Like, are they seeing some of the consequences? Very wise, all the things that you described. So I want you to, if you will, come back and let’s chat about this a little bit more, on this issue of eating disorders. Because again, there’s so much for us to talk about. Maybe we can continue this discussion on how we approach these types of problems, as we move through the counseling process, now that we have a good understanding of how we would approach it on the front end. So, Hannah, thanks for being with me today, and I look forward to maybe discussing this with you in the future.\\xa0\\nHannah Carter:\\xa0Thank you.

She’s an ACBC certified counselor. She has earned her master’s degree in christian counseling from the Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she’s assistant coordinator of women’s counseling. Her husband Jim, many of you know him, is the director of the christian counseling program and is an associate professor of counseling and practical theology at RTS Charlotte. She was a pastor’s wife for over 34 years, including six years in Saudi Arabia, before moving to Charlotte. She and Jim have three adult sons and four grandchildren. Caroline, we are so grateful to have you on the podcast with us today.\\xa0\\nCaroline Newheiser: Thank you for inviting me.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, this is a difficult subject. We can’t play around with the idea of eating disorders and some of their effects upon people, particularly young women, although not always the case. So, we want to make sure that we’re addressing this tenderly. And Caroline, you always do such a great job with that. I’m looking forward to our discussion today. As we get into this, we see influence in so many directions as to what raises awareness to a young lady about her image or about issues with eating. What’s your opinion on the role of social media? It’s certainly spread, there’s no question about that, but what is your opinion about the role of social media in spreading this problem of eating disorders?\\xa0\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0Well, the more young women I meet with, I realize the impact of comparison on one another through social media: looking at photos of each other, and then there are people who emphasize losing weight and body image. And if you look at even models on the runway, you see how a lot of them they look emaciated. Social media is spreading that idea with their favorite models or movie stars. And then you have fitness magazines. You have a lot of this emphasis that is damaging to young women.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, they get this picture that that is what normal life should be. Like we’ve not even mentioned the influence of things like photoshop and filters that people have on their phones. They’re getting these images that you know that are often not even real to life. And so, here we are comparing ourselves to images that are fabricated. And certainly, an idea that really says nothing about the difference in the way God makes each one of us as individuals. You know, as we skim and we see some of these influences and how it impacts particularly our young ladies: What do you see, as you counsel these types of issues as some of the root issues, some of the sins that motivate that type of behavior? what are some of those things that you see, Caroline?\\xa0\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0I’d like to emphasize the fact that there are root issues that are sins, so that anyone who’s listening to this podcast knows they can help other people. They don’t have to have a specialization, even in this topic. As long as they understand sin what it is and how it impacts a person, but also what the Bible says to help them with those sins. So, a girl I was working with, her first problem was fear of man. She had her mother telling her she was fat, and she was concerned about what other people thought of her looks. So, that was the first one we started with. I just talked to her about Proverbs 1:7. That the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and helping replacing fear of men with fear of the Lord.\\nBut underneath a lot of this is pride— it could be: “I’m so glad I’m not that,” “I look better than she does,” or “I don’t ever want to look like her.” So, I talked to these women about James 4:6, that God is opposed to the proud. He gives grace to the humble. So, trying to work with a girl in particular, one young lady—\\xa0She did not want me to tell her what to do. She had her own system in place. She was very proud and would not listen to counseling initially. A lot of these ladies to are legalistic; they make rules for themselves—No fats, no sugar, no salts. They have set up a whole system of legalism and that makes them feel good about themselves. We see a lot of that in our own lives, but we’re thankful for Romans 14, which says basically God makes the food rules. So, legalism in order to please self or to please whatever they think is leading them to be approved of by God; so that’s also the sin of perfectionism. “I want to be perfect. I want to be known as somebody with self-control, I don’t want to be controlled by food.” A lot of these women during covid became especially sensitive because they were in a place, in the time period that was out of control. That’s when they say, “this is the one thing I can do to control my life. I can control what I eat.”\\xa0 So, another sin area is lies. These women are deceitful: they lie to their moms, and they lie to their dads about what they ate. They lie to a counsel even. And they are really covering up their sin, because they don’t want to be seen as weak.\\xa0\\nAnd I have also encountered women who are hopeless. They say: “I have worked so hard to try to beat this, and I just don’t think I can. I don’t even see that God can do anything for me.” For some of these women, we know it’s a very deadly sin. That eating disorders can lead them to Hospitalization or death. So, we’re helping them to see the hope that comes from being in Christ; that if you’re belonging to Christ, He will help you. Philippians 1:6: He’s not going to leave you. And some of these women need to hear the Gospel for the first time. The power of the Gospel that can help them to change.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0And that’s what I want to get into as we talked about the Gospel.\\xa0You mentioned several things there that I think are really, really key. We’re talking about root issues because we’re not oblivious to the fact that these are bodily issues, that cause decay on the body. You even mention that they could lead to fatal implications, as well. I mean, so these are severe things that are affecting the body, but we have to see these particular root issues, these motivations, these moral dispositions as you described them. And Caroline, I really appreciate the way that you’re talking about this in a very religious framework. These are the things that are underlying: discontentment, that is constantly a bubbling up from underneath the surface. And these are critical issues that now help us to see: “okay, how can a Biblical counsellor be engaged in this.” And we’re not just saying, “you know, yeah, we want them to go see their physician to deal with some of the biological symptoms and the fallout that’s happening, because of their poor choices. But, if we unnecessarily distinguish and say, “Well, this is something that only the physician can deal with,” then they’re not getting to the root of the issue. They can treat the symptoms, and we want them to do that, but we have to deal with these root issues. And when you start introducing a topic and say: “Ah, the Gospel. We need to go to the Gospel,” some people don’t make that connection. But I think, you know, if you guys can understand the root issues in what we see in motivation underneath and how the Bible applies to that, then now we can see the beauty of the Gospel and why it’s necessary. So that brings us to that place, for you to explain a little bit more if you can a for us, about the importance of the Gospel in overcoming these weaknesses, and overcoming these sins. So, what I find Carolina, is that some of our counselors don’t always make the leap here. They don’t they don’t see: “Okay the Gospel, how does this connect to an issue like and eating disorders? That seems so crazy.” So, explain the importance of the Gospel here.\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0Well, I’ll tell you that when I was counseling a young lady with this problem. She finally came to me and said, “I listened to a sermon by John Piper, and he told me this is a sin!” And had been working with her for weeks and weeks, but when she realized that she was sinning against God, now we’re talking about the necessary Savior. So, also the necessity for confessing our sins, and praying for forgiveness, knowing God will cleanse us and purify us. So, she had to see herself as a sinner, who needs a Savior. But then, the Gospel also helps because we have Ephesians 4, where we begin the principle of: “I’m going to put on Christ but put off this sinful behavior.” And a girl who’s struggling, like a lot of us are struggling with besetting sins, we constantly remind ourselves: “I am no longer a slave to sin. I’m a slave to Christ.” So, the Gospel, knowing she’s saved, whether she needs to know it for the first time or apply the Gospel here, will give her victory. It will help her to start seeing that she has hope, she has purpose now, but also that she is in dwelt by the Holy Spirit. So, the Gospel coming in here \\xa0making a girl think of herself differently, because now her body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. And part of what our problem is that we tend to think the body is separate from behavior. So, I can do what I want with my body, but I’m still a spiritual person. But if we apply spiritual things to this part of life, we’ll say: “Oh, I know now that I have to treat my body differently, because I’m in dwelt by the Holy Spirit.”\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, that’s so good and a lot of people may say on issues like this: “I’m not sure; biblical counseling seems really wonderful. Can it really help somebody here?” I know I’ve experienced this. I can remember working with a young lady in high school, who was referred to us by local physician. And I can remember the depth of deception in her life, where even we had a nutritionist on board helping us. And the nutritionist wanted her to weigh every week; she would bring little fishing weights to put in her pocket. And you know, she was really afraid of that shame, that she wasn’t meeting goals that she had set, and that sort of thing. I’m talking about something that had gripped his young lady’s life. And then what we see a year later, working with her to see the beauty of the Gospel shine through her life repair a lot of what was going on in her family life. I’ve seen in my experience, and you’ve certainly worked with many young ladies, and you’ve seen this in your experience. I want you to describe, you know, how you’ve seen women change when they begin to love others more than themselves, when they struggle with these types of things.\\n\\xa0Caroline Newheiser: And that’s really what Christ was saying is the second greatest commandment: to love others. I had one young woman change, when she became pregnant. All of a sudden what she was doing to herself: very selfishly controlling her diet because of hurt and all these other factors. When she became pregnant now, she realizes: “I need to eat healthy because I love someone else more than I love myself.” That was the key. But some women are having to turn their thoughts of:\\xa0 “I’m going to do this, whether my parents care what I do or not,” to realize “My parents really do care. I love my dad. I love my mom. I know what they’re doing is not just trying to control me, but they’re actually loving me.” And to turn that around to loving man. Not to mention, how much of our Christian Life is involving table Fellowship, eating meals together. So, to go to for example a church potluck supper, and to agree to come, and sit, and have fellowship over a meal is very unselfish for a girl who’s been ruled by what she is supposed to eat and not supposed to eat.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I love how you’re offering the remedy that scripture provides against the issue of sin and motivation that they’re wrestling with their own heart. Because, you know, with these issues of eating disorders, it is very insular and self-focused. And some of the things practically that you’re saying are that we have to help them to see there’s a whole other world out there, with so many people there. That that the Lord has made us to love them, and care for them, and serve them. And sometimes all it takes is that that change in focus and heart to get them released from this bondage. Now, I want you to share some practical advice. We have counselors who are listening to this podcast right now, who have been asking that question: “Man, I’ve got somebody in my church who struggles with this, and I am really scared. I’m not sure what to do.” Caroline, share some advice, practical things that counselors can do who are working with these types of issues with eating.\\xa0\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0That’s a great question. And I’m glad you’ve already mentioned talking to a medical doctor, because this is something where you need to come alongside with someone else in the medical community because now, we’re talking: what is average standard calorie intake, that’s normal? What is a normal weight for somebody of this height and this age? So, you want to send the counselee back to the doctor to get some of these facts and treat it like something that’s needs to be helped. But I’ve also involved a nutritionist to begin to teach a young lady how much she should be eating, and how to balance those calories, and how to have self-control in certain areas. And I think, this is more prevalent than we realize. Because you have probably seen a lot of young ladies who have different restrictions, like no gluten. Which some of us have celiac disease, right? But others need to remember that God has created all things for us to enjoy. So, you bring in your medical professional, you bring in a nutritionist. But I also would advise you to bring in the family; it could be a husband who needs to hear what’s happening with his wife. It could be these parents because girl might be reacting to her mother. So now we’re going to bring in mom, and maybe you need to counsel mom for a while. But any good counselor will listen well, will listen with compassion, without showing shock on your face, or horror, or asking nagging questions, but:\\xa0 “I love you. I want to care for you. I want to help you.” And I know that a good counselor will do that; one who’s biblically based, who has a love of Christ in them.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0These are such helpful tips. I can remember you mentioned working with a nutritionist; the one that I worked with consistently had at just an ability to explain to the young ladies that when they hear certain caloric intake, they get really nervous, the ladies do, but a nutritionist can really help them to see and not be overwhelmed with the amount of food intake, the amount of caloric intake. They can help to adjust meals in such a way that it’s more likely that the individual will eat that much at a given meal. And it’s just very helpful with the knowledge, that they have to be able to get them back up to a good body weight. Man, some really helpful pieces of advice: I encourage you as well, as you said about family; sometimes I swear that deception happens most. And then having somebody in the family who helps to keep them accountable at the times where they are most vulnerable. And all those things are very important. So, Caroline tough topic, really, really tough. Thank you for doing that and thank you for sharing that with us and giving us some encouragement here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline Newheiser is the Assistant Coordinator of Women’s Counseling at Reformed Theological Seminary – Charlotte.

      "{'title': 'Help for Eating Disorders and Distorted Thinking', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Kimberly Clark', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': 'When we are trying to recreate our own identity, we are nullifying the grace of God.', 'body': 'My name is Kimberly Clark. I have been counseling biblically since 1999. I got certified in 2002 and did about 12 years of one-hour counseling. Then, for the last eight years I’ve been doing intensive biblical counseling, which involves seeing people for three days and then sending them out with a plan. I am now with Known By Him Ministries and continuing in that same vein.\\nWhen I first started counseling—especially with the intensive counseling—and people with more severe problems were coming in, I could easily say that the area where I felt least confident was eating disorders. Part of that lack of confidence came from being so distracted by what I was seeing. Seeing people come in with their bones sticking out, with doctors telling them that they’re about ready to die if they don’t change something, with so many strange behaviors, and with such self-deceit was glaring. Yet these people totally believed that what they were doing was the right thing to do and they were willing to do anything to achieve their goals.\\nI quickly learned that I was in a territory where I needed some help. I’m going to take you on this journey that I’ve been on, and I hope that I can bequeath wisdom to you related to any deficiencies that I’ve had in this area. I want you to finish reading this feeling like, “Okay, the next person I meet with an eating disorder, I am ready to go.”\\nGeneral Information (Statistics, Definition, and Symptoms)\\nThe statistics say:\\nIn 2019, there were 30 million people in the United States with an eating disorder.51% of nine- and ten-year-olds say that they feel better about themselves if they’re dieting.People with eating disorders are 56 times more likely to commit suicide. I’ve seen a number of these women who had tried to commit suicide because they felt like a failure.People with eating disorders are 4 times more likely to be abusing substances.\\nWe’ll use this definition from the Mayo Clinic as a helpful starting point, though I would tweak it a little bit if I were writing it: “Eating disorders are a serious condition related to persistent eating behaviors that negatively impact someone’s health, emotions, and ability to function in important areas of life. The most common eating disorders are anorexia, bulimia, and binge eating.”\\nIn my experience, a lot of times the loved ones or husband of the woman with the eating disorder were the ones who were telling me what was going on but was not obvious. The reason for this was that the women who were entrenched in the disorder were trying to cover up all of the things that they were doing. I want to share some typical examples of behaviors or signs that you might see with people with eating disorders:\\nBeing very secretive and pretty manipulativeHaving bones sticking out, a lot of times in a really grotesque wayLosing their concentration and having difficulty even thinking or following through with a thoughtMaking excuses for whatever eating issues are going onWearing multiple layers of clothes so that they can disguise how thin they really are, especially if their loved ones are getting on to themRecurring constipationStrict observance to very restrictive dietsExcessive focus on healthy eatingMaking their own meals, rather than eating what the family eatsWithdrawing from normal social activitiesPersistent worry or complaining about being fat and talk of losing weightFrequent checking in the mirror for perceived flaws (note the key word perceived)Use of dietary supplements, laxatives or herbal products for weight lossExcessive exerciseCalluses on the knuckles from inducing vomitingProblems with loss of tooth enamel that may be a sign of repeated vomitingLeaving during meals to use the toiletPushing food around on their plate to make it look like they’re eating and make it look like they have more on their plate than they actually do.An inability to sit comfortably or instability in walking because there is a deterioration of muscles in the legs\\nI’ve had women come in with layers and layers of clothing despite the fact that it was super, super hot outside and not all that cool inside. I tend to run cold and be the coldest person in the room, but looking at these people I would think, “I don’t know how you’re doing it right now. You’ve got to have your own personal sauna going on.” Some women will just read and read and read anything that they can get their hands on about what healthy eating means. You know how often those guidelines change and how many opposing voices there are.\\nExamples from Counseling Experience\\nNow I want to tell you about a couple of the women that really stand out to me in my counseling career.\\nI had a woman who tried to show and explain to me how she kept track of her eating. She counted calories, carbs, sugar, and a few other things that I forget right now, in addition to counting the number of bites. She even had a way to graph this. Her every waking moment was analyzing what she ate last and then planning for her next meal. She was so stressed out about whether she thought she had failed with her last meal or if she was going to get it just right with her next meal. Can you imagine her thinking? Her thinking was racing. It was exhausting to watch her. She had a really hard time carrying on a conversation with me because her brain just wanted to keep going back to reviewing, reviewing, and reviewing her meals. Leading up to lunch time she got more and more stressed. There was also the question of whether or not she was going to feel condemned or like she deserved a reward for how she had done on the last meals that she could remember. Most often it was condemnation.\\nAnother woman I worked with dealt with severe constipation because of years of an eating disorder. Her husband had to put her in the bathtub every night to get warm water on her and massage her belly so that she could relieve herself. It was extremely painful. She hated the hours leading up to that bath. She was so fragile that there was no way that she could get in that bathtub by herself. Yet she was still fully persuaded that she needed to stay on her “diet.” She was not in counseling because she thought she needed help; she was there because her husband was desperate. With that particular woman, I found out way into Day 2 that she had been sitting on a secret sin for years and had been so fearful for anybody to ever know about that secret sin.\\nI’ve worked with numerous women who have tried to commit suicide because their rigid way of following their own rules leads them to feel like a failure. Catch that: it’s not because they have an eating disorder that they want to commit suicide; it’s because they’re not able to follow their own rules.\\nThe Root: Gaining Control by Following a Law\\nNow I want us to try to look at the root of what’s going on with these individuals. At some point, these people felt like life was so out of control that they had to figure out a way to get control. I think we can all relate to times in our lives when we just felt like everything was falling apart, and if we could grab every straw that we could possibly think of, we would. These people really did decide at some point that eating was the only area of their life that they could control. On hearing their stories, sometimes I would think, “Okay, yeah, that makes sense to me. Life was super out of control.” But for them, no one is going to make them eat. The thought process for these women is: “They can make me do everything else, but they can’t make me eat. That is one area I can control no matter what the consequences are.”\\nThen we have these outside forces that are constantly barraging us with the message of what we need to look like. Unfortunately, some families are sending horrible messages to their kids. There have been times when I have sat in a counseling room choking back tears hearing what some parents have said to their kids, whether the parents thought that their kid was chubby or that their kid just wasn’t measuring up. As a result, this child felt like the only thing they could do to measure up was to lose weight.\\nI haven’t experienced anorexia. I haven’t experienced bulimia. I’ve overeaten, believe me, but I think I just like food too much. As a result and with all that I’ve mentioned above, I questioned how to relate to these women. I started to ask the Lord, “Help me to understand this area of eating disorders. I feel like I’m falling so far short. How do I relate to these women?”\\nOne thing that is consistent from the descriptions that I’ve given you is that these women are following a law. We have a book in the Bible that speaks directly to this issue. I have become madly in love with the book of Galatians. When Paul was talking to these Galatians, what was he upset about? He was upset about the Galatians going back to Judaism and to the law and serving the flesh. That sounds like what I’ve described with the eating disorder. As I studied and plumbed Galatians, I loved it and I’ll probably continue to plumb it until the day that I die. I’ve seen more and more of how this book directly speaks to those with eating disorders.\\nLessons from Galatians\\nOne of my first observations from Galatians is that I see Paul spending almost two chapters telling the Galatians why he’s qualified to talk to them. At first, I’m thinking, “Okay, Paul, we get it. You’re an apostle; God spoke directly to you. You went to God school for three whole years. I get it.” But there was a reason why he was telling this to the Galatians, and the reason was for him to be able to make the case to the Galatians that they needed to listen to him. He needed to persuade them why they should listen to him of all people. What was his dependency? It was Christ. He said over and over that Christ gave him his message directly and that he even got it verified by the other apostles. It’s not like it was something that was made up in his head.\\nHow do we apply that to us? That is a very good question. I’ve already told you that I have not had these issues with starving myself or making myself puke. If I look at a gallon of ice cream, I’m going to get pretty sick pretty fast at the thought of eating the whole gallon. My overeating is more of a general all-day eating. Here are some questions that I think we as counselors need to be able to answer to be able to help us relate to these women and present why we are qualified to talk to these women:\\nWhen have I relied on the Law rather than the Spirit?When have I been tempted to think that my way would be better than God’s way?When has it seemed like following God was too hard and my way of doing things seemed more right?When has it seemed that there was a better way to get acceptance, approval, and value outside of the gospel?How is it that the gospel has saved me over and over and over again?\\nThose are the questions that I think you need to be asking yourself and be ready to give an answer to these women as to why God has qualified you to be their counselor. I always tell my counselees something about my struggles at an appropriate level. Below is an example for you, and it might sound funny but it’s been a genuine struggle for me.\\nThere is a lady at our church who is mentally challenged and collects pop can tabs. Every time you come into church, she’s hunting you down and wants your pop tabs. I drink seltzer water and my husband indulges in other pop drinks, so we have a fair number of tabs. I feel like I need to save every one of those tabs. Every single one of those tabs needs to go in a bowl. In our kitchen, I have a designated cupboard for that. When I leave town, I have a pocket and I keep putting them in my pocket. I become obsessed about those pop tabs.\\nJust today, I said to myself—and I’ve told myself on other trips too—”You have to stop.” I would like to go into the trash cans and get other people’s tabs because I know that would make her really happy. She gets so excited to take those to our children’s hospital. However, it becomes a burden to me because I’ve made it into a law. You would not believe the relief that I get when I finally recognize what I’m doing and say, “Kim, it’s okay if you throw away a can that has a tab on it. It’ll be okay.” I am not pleasing God more when I keep that tab.\\nBut what’s going on in my heart? I don’t want to disappoint her. That’s fear of man. Is she going to know that I didn’t collect every tab? No. But I still feel bad, as if it were a flaw. I put that burden on myself. Today I just realized I’m not carrying tabs in these pockets. I don’t have a pair of jeans on today with a pocket in the back. It’s okay. God is just fine with me putting that whole can in the trash.\\nThat’s just a simple illustration as to how we can make our own laws and start to bow down to them without even knowing that we have slipped into this law camp.\\nGalatians is all about talking to a group of people who had once proclaimed the gospel and had started to backslide by trying to keep and rely on the law. They wanted acceptance; they wanted value. Until you really start to see the correlations between the person with the eating disorder and the Galatians, it’s probably not going to make a lot of sense.\\nPaul confronted Peter in front of everybody. Can you imagine confronting Peter? Probably not, but Paul did it in front of everybody so it must have been a pretty serious thing. The whole book is about this topic. Here is Peter having meals with the Gentiles and eating unclean food in his freedom in Christ. He was witnessing to these Gentiles and they were being won over to the gospel. Then, the Judaizers—the circumcised Jews—came into town. What were they saying? In disgust, they would say, “You’re with the Gentiles and you’re eating with them. Whoa.” Then Peter quickly moves away and who else comes with him? Barnabas. That means that Peter was leading others astray. Paul then says, “You have just nullified the grace of God.” That’s how serious this is.\\nNow let’s think about the perceived benefits for Peter and Barnabas to leave the camp where they had freedom in Christ to move back into the camp of works, the law, and the flesh. What did they see as the benefit? Acceptance; no persecution; approval; and status.\\nDo you remember the deal about, “Oh, you’re a Gentile.” How were Gentiles seen? As dogs. How were Jews seen? As children of Abraham. Galatians says that they were observing seasons and holidays. They were really embracing this whole idea of who they were, or in other words, their identity. What does identity focus on? Identity focuses on me, self, and flesh because identity is going to draw attention to what I’m doing instead of Christ increasing as I decrease.\\nIn whom do those in the camp of freedom in Christ put their trust? God.\\nIn whom do those in the camp of the law put their trust? Self.\\nThe irony of this is that there’s a lot of condemnation in the camp of the law because we’re never going to follow this law perfectly. There’s also going to be a lot of sense of reward because now we think we deserve reward and so we’re either going to hold that against God—because He withheld reward from us—or we’re going to reward ourselves.\\nWhen I start to break all of that down, what’s going on for this person with the eating disorder makes a whole lot more sense to me. I realize that this thinking has been progressive. It wasn’t that she woke up one morning and all of a sudden had this great idea that made her decide to be enslaved to this type of thinking and eating for the next 30 years.\\nTwo passages in Galatians that are so helpful and that I think we can use as biblical counselors are:\\nGalatians 3:1-3: “O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified. Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith? Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?”Galatians 4:9: “But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?”\\nAren’t those verses convicting? You have a woman who wants to control something in her life and wants to be thin. These verses show the truth about that quest. How do we, as biblical counselors, translate that into our counseling? What do we do with this information? What I do is gently dig towards the answers to the following questions:\\nWhat happened?How did you decide that approval, acceptance, and value would be gained from following these rules?\\nI’m not going to come right out and ask these questions first thing. Rather\\xa0I try to come in the back door, the side door, or the trap door—however I can be trying to get these answers. I want to know what she’s doing and eventually genuinely help her to see that and the trigger that caused such a drastic bewitching.\\nThe other questions that I ask myself the whole time are:\\nWhat is the lie that she’s bought into?What has Satan promised her?\\nThose answers will ultimately spell out her law system and what it is that she’s going after. Paul was adamant that this way of living and thinking was a perverted gospel and that individuals that go down that path were under a curse. That’s pretty strong language. I’m going to tell you that when you are dealing with somebody who is deeply entrenched in this, you will confirm with Paul that they’re under a curse. This is very serious.\\nAs a word of caution to us as counselors, heed Galatians 6:1 that tells us to be gentle and watch ourselves lest we too be tempted. Also heed Ephesians 6:10-20 that tells us to put on the whole armor of God. We should always be doing that, but I’m just going to remind you that in these situations, you do not want to forget that.\\nAll of us have a propensity to want to self-craft our identity. We see this in extremes right now with our culture. We see people wanting to reassign their gender or their race. It’s really being pushed to a great extreme. However, re-crafting our identity is integral to understanding how this law system works because these people and we ourselves are all guilty of this to some degree or another. We have visions of what we think we should be.\\nHow many people do you hear wishing to look a certain way or lamenting over flaws or parts of them that they don’t think look right. I hear it all the time. They wish they could have a better body, a better face, wealth, position, or respect. What would it deliver or give them? There’s something behind those desires that they’re driving for whether they realize it or not. For many girls and women, the promise is that if we could have the perfect body or the perfect face, we’d have everything. We would have power and we would have control. Wouldn’t that be sweet? We don’t say it quite that directly, but that quest is very, very present even in our churches. This is not just out there in the world.\\nThere’s this quest. This temptation is constantly presented to our flesh: “Be more, be better, be beautiful, be a certain type.” We see it everywhere we go. You can’t stand in line at the grocery store without seeing what we’re all supposed to look like. I thought that temptation would go away once I got older. Now I’m finding out that when I watch commercials about special potent skin products that will make me look younger, I find those products appealing. Then I think to myself, “You wanted to be old. You are old. It’s okay. Enjoy it. You’re old, get over it.”\\nThat temptation to self-craft our identity is something that we will have. From that standpoint, we can relate to these individuals with eating disorders. I’ve worked with a lot of women that identify with past abuse and are trying to run away from that identity. For them, that puts more fuel on the fire because whoever the abuser was could have said different things to them about their looks. Those words and however they have perceived their identity post-abuse have great ramifications. You want to be able to check that out and see what about that experience is causing them to try to recreate their identity.\\nRemember, when we are trying to recreate our own identity, we are nullifying the grace of God. That is so convicting for me.\\nIn Isaiah, nation after nation was judged for what they did with their power. Over and over, it came down to how they treated the oppressed, such as widows and orphans. Isaiah 3:16-24 describes women who were haughty and wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they went, tinkling with their feet. God was going to take all of their beauty tools and make them rotten. Instead of beauty, He was going to give them baldness, a skirt of sackcloth, and branding.\\nAn identity of beauty for the use of power is certainly an abomination to the Lord. Help the woman you are counseling and help yourself first to be able to see what this quest for beauty is all about. For example, think about women who are trying to use their beauty to get a man to love them. How many have been guilty of that, whether or not that was something we said out loud?\\nPaul again makes this super, super clear. He says that our identity as Christians is that we are children of God. Period. End of story. Anything else will take us to the law camp. The truth is Jesus plus nothing. Paul says that the Galatians were going back to pursue the worthless elementary principles of the world and He instead has called us to freedom in Christ.\\nWhat are we free to do?\\nWe are free to say “no” to sin. We’re no longer underneath the obligation to say “yes” to sin. In Christ, we can say “no.” We don’t have to submit to a yoke of slavery.We are free from condemnation. Law-living produces a lot of condemnation. It’s an awful place to be. When you’re presenting this to these dear sweet ladies, remember what you’re calling them to. There are so many benefits in Christ.We are free to have peace. That’s Romans 15:13. We have God’s grace for the whole walk.We are free to love. This is huge. Paul talks about the fact that the difference in walking in the Spirit is that now we are free to love. He sums up the law as being “love your neighbor as yourself.” There’s great freedom in me loving God and loving others. The alternative in the law camp is: “I’m so afraid. I am so fearful. I don’t know where God is. I don’t know if He really cares and I am so afraid of what you’re going to think of me. I’ve got to hide somehow. I’ve got to re-craft myself.”\\nMake sure that you’re not communicating that there’s no struggle. Life in Christ does not mean that we are free from struggle. Some people will say, “Oh, I’m going to follow Christ and there’s not going to be any struggle.” No, I didn’t say that. Paul certainly doesn’t say that. Scripture doesn’t say that. Our fight really begins at conversion, but we’re fighting the good fight. After conversion, we are called to demonstrate the fruit of the Spirit. Paul goes on to say that producing fruits is in keeping with being saved, and not producing fruits—if you’re continuing in this sin—should lead to questioning one’s salvation.\\nPractical Strategies\\nBelow I will flush out some of the typical things that I do with people once I’ve understood the situation and the root of their behavior and once I’m in the process of helping them see what’s actually going on underneath the surface.\\n1. Using the tree diagram, replace the fruit in the diagram with all of the presenting issues. Then work your way down\\xa0through emotions, meditations, motivations, values, identity, and theology.\\n2. Take Galatians, section by section, putting their life and their words over Galatians and helping them to see what God’s Word would say directly to them in their situation.\\n3. At some point, with wisdom, ask for repentance.\\nAll I mean by repentance—and I tell people this all the time—is that I ask them\\xa0to agree with what God says and to agree that they’re going to follow God and turn away from their old ways. I do not ask that they be perfect.\\n4. Get them into a regular reading of the Word.\\nThis is so important and I can’t stress this enough. The power for them is in the Word. The thinking of people with eating disorders has been so perverted. If they’ve been doing this for years, their mind is racing non-stop. I don’t want them to read the Word just for the sake of reading the Word and checking off a box and saying, “Oh yeah, I did it.” I don’t want that for them. I want them to be able to read the Word and start to understand and question the Word. I put a little activity with their reading of the Word. I have them buy a new journal and write down what they learned about God and what they learn about their identity in each passage. I want them to keep telling me what they’re learning.\\n5. Ask them to do some Bible art.\\nWhen I do this, I get all kinds of objections about what a terrible artist they are and that they’ve never been artistic. I don’t care. I tell them that they can go on Google and find a cartoon and trace it. It doesn’t matter. The point is that I want them to think about the meaning of the verses that I have assigned. I intentionally assign verses and want them to think about the meaning of those verses because this is going to re-shape their view of who God is. I want them to see the goodness of God. I want them to see what God says to His own child. This has been a marvelous tool. Even the people that go down kicking and screaming end up loving it.\\n6. Make a plan out of Galatians.\\nPart of Galatians talks about how there is a lot of strife and envy in the lives of people who are underneath the law. Similarly, a lot of times, people who are struggling with eating disorders have a lot of broken relationships. Can you imagine years of being in this type of living? Can you imagine the experience of their family or friends and what it is like for them to be in relationship with somebody with this level of deceit who is being totally enslaved to a specific diet?\\nClosing Example\\nI want to tell you about my friend Florence. I changed her name and looked up a 1920s name to use in place of her real name. Florence was pursuing the identity of skinny. She had tried to commit suicide several times because she felt like a failure. She had a horrible childhood. If I were to rate her childhood compared to other stories that I’ve heard, I would consider her childhood pretty traumatic or pretty horrendous. Her family regularly referred to her as a mistake. For most of her childhood she did not know who her biological mother was. The biological mother was presented for years as the aunt that didn’t live in the home. She never knew who her biological father was. There was tons of abuse. Later on, when she got married, her husband and her children knew very, very well about her obsession to be skinny. In her mind, she needed to be the perfect mom that she never had. The ideal in her head was to be skinny and to be the perfect mom.\\nWhen her children got to an age where they didn’t need her anymore, the world came crashing in. She ended up falling to pieces. The eating disorder got much, much worse. She ended up going to a psychiatrist and a psychologist and taking lots of medicines. She had Scripture tattooed all over her body. Nothing was working. Her husband was just beside himself. He had tried everything to love her and love her well, and he couldn’t get through. She reluctantly agreed to spend three whole days with me. Can you imagine?\\nIt was super difficult. There were many times that I did not know if we were going to make it through the whole three days. Any time I started to suggest or maybe even get close to intimating that maybe she had made a mistake—I wasn’t even using the word sin yet—she would get so angry because any perceived failure on her part was the same thing as condemnation. She could not separate them.\\nBy God’s grace, we made it through the three days. God started to uncover things for her and she started to see. She went and got a pink fuzzy journal that she used to start doing her Bible art. There were so many times that I was just choking back the tears as I continued to meet with her because the Scriptures were coming alive to her. She felt like she needed to confess to me that she needed a little Google help on some of them. I replied, “I could care less. The fact is that you’re getting these truths.” That has been a super fun situation.\\nI tell you all that to be able to say that there are creative ways that we can get people into the Word. I’ll share with you about her tree chart.\\nHer fruit: She had these unhealthy eating rules and was essentially starving herself. She was staying in bed for inordinate amounts of time. She had absolutely no hope. She saw everything through a negative lens. She had fractured relationships all across the board—immediate family, extended family—and it was just a mess.Her emotions: Sad and angry. She went back and forth and sometimes she could do both.Her meditation: “I need to be skinny. I need my family to need me. I need God to be okay with me.”Her motivations: “I want to be approved of. I want to be accepted by my family.”Her values: “I want to be a good mother. I want to be skinny. I want to have a husband who thinks that I’m the most beautiful woman.”Her identity: Beautiful, skinny, mother, and wife. That’s what she wanted.Her theology (how she saw God): “God doesn’t care. He’s too difficult to please. He wants me to be fat and He doesn’t care if I suffer.”\\nShe wouldn’t have come in saying any of the above, but as we worked through and got closer and closer to being able to unearth these, then she was able to see them.\\nEven after we were getting through some of this, in her mind everything would all be good if I could just help her become better at obeying her own rules. I’d have to keep going back to telling her that she was nullifying the grace of God and that God says she was not following Him. I would say, “Here’s the truth. God is good. God does want good for you even if you put some pounds on.” She wasn’t real thin so it wasn’t like she was in any kind of danger of dying, but she was pretty sure that she was super fat.\\nI had to ask her to agree to give up her psychologists for six months and meet with me instead. She was very afraid to do that because it had been years since she had not been with a psychologist, but she agreed. I said, “Hey, what do you have to lose? It’s Jesus and His Word. Let’s see what Jesus does.”\\nIt’s been way past 6 months and she hasn’t mentioned a psychologist. She is out there telling everybody that she knows, “Jesus is the Way and you’re under law. You don’t know it, but you’re under law.” She has a message and she is ready to tell everybody. She has the Scriptures tattooed on her as well so it’s easy for her to reference Scripture quickly. She’s forever telling me that I need to get on her church website and listen to the sermons. The sermons have come alive to her. I’m pretty sure the sermons didn’t just overnight get good.\\nOne thing that is so common and that I want you to know too is that these people who are overcoming eating disorders start to want to pursue Christianity with that same works mentality. She started to lament to me that she doesn’t have a ton of Scripture memorized and can’t debate the Scriptures like “all those other Christians.” She would love to be able to debate the Scriptures like “those other Christians.” She thought that all of us have Scripture memorized and that all of us can debate. We’ve had to go back to, “Okay, what are you doing now? What is this?” I keep telling her that the Christian walk is to repent and have faith. That process of repentance and having faith is no different for anybody else. We’re all on the same journey of repentance and faith.\\nI just want to encourage you and hope that the next time somebody says, “Hey, I have somebody with an eating disorder and she has been doing this for 20 years. Her husband is ready to check into a place for husbands that can’t take it anymore. Would you take her?” I want you to say, “Yes, Lord, I will, because I know the Lord and I have a book in my Bible called Galatians.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKimberly Clark works at Known by Him Ministries.

      "{'title': 'Vanity or Body Image Problem?', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Martha Peace', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': \"True modesty doesn't come from changing one's wardrobe. It comes from having one's heart changed.\", 'body': \"Vanity is not a word you hear about much these days, but you do hear about body image problems. A body image problem sounds much more serious and important than the sin of vanity does. Today, I want to define some terms, briefly present what the secular psychologist thinks about this issue, what the Christian psychologist or the integrationist thinks, what one Keswick Christian author thinks, and then spend the main time with what the biblical counselor thinks. I want to give you, lastly, some practical tips on counseling a woman who is vain.\\xa0\\nDefinition of Terms\\nBody image is defined as a person’s perception of the aesthetics, the beauty of or sexual attractiveness of one’s own body, what one thinks about her body. The phrase “body image” was first coined by the Austrian neurologist and psychoanalyst Dr. Paul Schilder in his book, The Image and Appearance of the Human Body, published in 1935. Human society has at all times placed great value on the beauty of the human body, but a person’s perception of her own body may not correspond to what other people are thinking. \\nResearch suggests that exposure to mass media depicting the thin, ideal body may be linked to body image disturbance in women. The DSM, which is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\\xa0has made this a disease, and they call it “body dysmorphic disorder.” Dysmorphic means malformed or misshapen, pertaining to the shape or size of a body part. Body dysmorphic disorder or BDD is a listed as a mental disorder characterized by an obsessive preoccupation with some aspect of one’s own appearance, believing it to be severely flawed, warranting exceptional measures to hide it or to fix it. In BDD delusional (someone who’s delusional is out of touch with reality) variant, the flaw is imagined; it’s not real or if it is real, its importance is severely exaggerated. Either way, one’s thoughts about it are pervasive and intrusive, occupying up to several hours a day. The DSM-5 categorizes it in the obsessive-compulsive spectrum and distinguishes it from anorexia nervosa. BDD is estimated to affect up to 2.4 percent of the population, and it usually starts during adolescence. It also affects men and women, usually equally. Whereas vanity concerns preoccupation with aggrandizing the appearance, BDD is compulsion to merely normalize the appearance, although delusional. In about one in three cases, the appearance concern is usually an overvalued idea. They tend to preoccupy over minimal or non-existent flaws in their appearance. They may view themselves as deformed or unattractive, generally focusing on the face, hair, and other areas of the body such as the stomach, thighs, and hips. Any area can be the preoccupation.\\nOn average someone who is diagnosed with BDD tends to focus on five to seven different body parts, examining their appearance multiple times a day is a regular occurrence, and can take between three to eight hours of their time on a daily basis. Common behaviors include mirror checking or avoiding a mirror, outfit changing, skin picking, excessive grooming, and restrictive eating. Victims of BDD often identify with feelings of low self-esteem, shame, and unworthiness. Via BDD, some people experience delusions that others are covertly pointing out their flaws. They get paranoid. Because they’re so obsessed with their bodies, they think everybody else is. They use social avoidance or camouflaging with cosmetics or apparel, repetitively checking their appearance, comparing it to that of other persons, and might often seek verbal reassurance.\\xa0 Its severity can wax and wane. Flare-ups tend to yield absences. They can withdraw and stop going to work or school. They tend to stay home and not socialize with other people, and\\xa0they can become housebound. The distress of it tends to exceed that of either major depressive disorder or type 2 diabetes, and the rates of suicide ideation and attempts are especially high.\\nLet me just summarize the underlying psychological issues. Somebody comes to you, and they have this diagnosis. I want you to understand what this diagnosis means; it is describing how they behave and what they’re thinking. Underlying psychological issues are low self-esteem, perfectionism, negative body image, childhood physical abuse, depression, anxiety, self-disparagement, feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, inadequacy, obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behavior between three to eight hours a day, and a tendency to greatly exaggerate any flaw. One out of three are delusional. They have high rates of suicide and suicide attempts and preoccupation with five to seven body parts, delusions that others are pointing out their flaws, depression, social avoidance, childhood sexual abuse, parental neglect, or have been teased or bullied.\\xa0\\nI did a brief survey of some of the psychology helps available.\\xa0There is a popular workbook by Dr. Thomas Cash, a PhD psychologist, called\\xa0The Body Image Workbook. It’s an eight-step program for learning to like how you look. He says, “Talk therapy does not work. Behavior modification does.” Another book that I found is Living with Your Body and Other Things You Hate by Emily K. Sandoz and M. Troy DuFrene. They are psychologists, and the subtitle of the book is How to Let go of Your Struggle with Body Image Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. I also have some Christian psychology or integrationist examples such as Loving Your Body: Embracing Your True Beauty in Christ by Deborah Newman, a licensed psychologist, published by Focus on the Family. Focus on the Family did a survey and concluded that the primary reason for women to have low self-esteem is because they have a negative body image. This book helps the reader understand that they are wonderfully and beautifully made in God’s image.\\nAnother example is a book called My Big Bottom Blessing: How Hating my Body Led to Loving my Life by Teasi Cannon. She has a master’s degree in pastoral counseling from Liberty Theological Seminary. She’s very funny, and she writes well. I read it, and it was an intriguing book. She’s very heavily influenced by the Sonship controversy, a Keswick view of sanctification. You don’t make effort; you just let God work through you. I was very uncomfortable with how she talked about God, which was in a very trite way. She did not view Him with awe, and I want to give you an example of this because I want you to be discerning. When you read a book that trifles with God, don’t use it. Cannon said, “I can almost hear the conversations that must have gone on in heaven when God was designing me. ‘This daughter of mine (this is God speaking) is going to love beauty, but I want her to love my beauty. So, I’m going to put a little extra padding on her to keep her from being vain. Vanity would kill her.'” Don’t talk about God like that. We are to bow before Him and humble ourselves before Him and glorify Him.\\xa0\\nI want to talk about the biblical counseling view now. I wrote a book a while back called Damsels in Distress, and it has a chapter on vanity that you could use as a resource that has study questions at the end of the chapter. More recently, one of my pastors Kent Keller and I wrote a book called Modesty: More Than a Change of Clothes, and that one is also very convicting. We originally titled it Gold Ring in a Pig’s Snout, and we loved our title, but P&R did not love it. We finally got to the end of the grueling process of editing, and they said, “We just can’t live with this title!”\\nIt’s a heart change. It really is. Here’s some background to teach your counselee. You want to know what they’re thinking.\\xa0 I would have them do a self-talk log. When they are thinking about their body, when they’re obsessing about it, when they’re struggling with that, I would ask them to write down what they’re thinking and then bring it back so I can see. Because as a man thinks in his heart so is he, and that is what is in their hearts. Vanity is something that is empty, futile, vain or worthless. Webster’s Dictionary says, ” Vanity, in the sense of the love of beauty, is an inflated pride in one’s appearance.”\\nVanity in the Old Testament\\nLet’s look at Isaiah chapter 3 because this is such a vivid example of how God views vain women. It is a sign of a decadent society and unstable women. It’s a sign of the disintegration of a nation. The daughters of Zion, the Jewish women, had become like the societies around them, and the Canaanite societies were pagan. They were carnal, and the Jews turned from worshipping God to worshiping the Canaanite idols. Isaiah lived 700 years before Christ was born, and he prophesied about judgment to come. The southern kingdom, Judah, was about to go the way of the northern kingdom, which had become apostate, and they became idolaters, even sooner than the southern kingdom. They had already been taken captive by Assyria, and Judah was about to be taken captive by Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylon. So, they have turned from God to serving other gods; one of them for these women was the god of beauty.\\nIsaiah 3:16-24 says, “Moreover, the Lord said, ‘Because the daughters of Zion are proud and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes, and go along with mincing steps and tinkle the bangles on their feet, [They must have had ankle bracelets with bells on them or bells on their shoes, and when they would walk, those bells would go off and everybody would notice them] Therefore, the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs, and the Lord will make their foreheads bare.’ In that day the Lord will take away the beauty [Listen to this list] of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, dangling earrings, bracelets, veils, headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, amulets, finger rings, nose rings, festal robes, outer tunics, cloaks, money purses, hand mirrors, undergarments, turbans and veils.” And you thought you had a lot to do to get ready this morning. “Now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume there will be putrefaction; [Putrefaction is the smell of rotting flesh] Instead of a belt, a rope [Because they’re going to be slaves]; Instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp; Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth [There will be grief and mourning]; and branding instead of beauty.”\\nThese women thought they were so beautiful and so attractive, and they deliberately called much attention to themselves, and God saw this as very ugly. This is not a pretty picture, and neither is it pretty to God when we love ourselves and spend inordinate amounts of time and money on our appearance or obsess about our bodies, calling attention to ourselves.\\xa0\\nHow to Overcome Vanity\\nLet’s look at how to overcome vanity. Obviously, vanity is a sin, but first, have your counselee read the following signs of vanity and mark the ones they know they are guilty of.\\n1. I am overly concerned about how I look.\\xa0\\n2. I’m unable to graciously receive compliments. Instead of graciously saying, “Thank you,” I become embarrassed or angry at that person.\\xa0\\n3. I feel depressed or anxious because “I’m fat.”\\xa0\\n4. I’m on a quest for thinness that sometimes results in abuse of my body through bulimia or anorexia.\\n5. I overspend on clothes, hair, and makeup.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n6. I compare myself to others and how they look.\\xa0\\n7. I say things to elicit compliments from others.\\xa0\\nMy husband is so funny. We were going to a party years ago, and we dressed up. And I had on what I thought was a very pretty dress. I was a lot thinner back then. I got all dolled up, and I came, in all of my grandeur, into the living room, and he’s sitting there waiting for me to get ready, and he didn’t say anything. He did say, “Are you ready to go?”\\xa0 Finally, I just floated around him, and he didn’t say anything. I said, “How do I look?” He looked me up and down and said, “Fine.” So, I’m thinking, “That’s all I’m going to get.” We went to the party, and a friend of ours was there. He was not flirting with me; he’s just a nut, and the two of us at one point ended up at the buffet table together, and he said, “You look stunning!” I said, “Oh, thank you!”\\xa0 When we got home, I told Sanford, “Do you remember when I asked you how I looked before the party?” He said he didn’t. I told him that he just said that I looked fine. He said, “Well, you do look fine. Your slip wasn’t showing. I mean, you know, you’re fine.” I asked if he wanted to know what Mike said? This got his attention, and he kind of turned a little red, and he said, “What?” I said, “He said I look stunning!” He said, “I think you look stunning, too!” It doesn’t matter what I look like; I am stunning. Just don’t bother to ask, but some people say things to elicit compliments from others.\\n8. I refuse to have sex with my husband because I feel ugly or fat.\\xa0\\n9. I often apologize for how they look.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI know a lady in my hometown, and I’ve known her for a long time. I don’t see her very often, but every once in a while, I run into her. She’s beautiful. She looks like a model. Every time I see her, she apologizes for how she looks, and I’m thinking, “I wish I looked like that.” Obviously, that’s what’s on her mind. She’s obsessed with it.\\xa0\\n10. I find myself thinking about my body flaws often.\\xa0\\n11. I dress in a sensual or immodest manner.\\xa0\\n12. I go back to the mirror again and again to see how I look.\\xa0\\n13. I withdraw from social situations because I feel self-conscious about how I look.\\xa0\\n14. I feel anxious or depressed about how I look.\\nSanford and I went out to eat with another couple one night, and I was just having so much fun. We were just talking and laughing. After the meal, I went into the restroom and looked in the mirror, and I had dried food on my face. I mean, it was a big blob of food. I was so embarrassed! I cleaned it off, and when we got in the car to go home, I said, “Didn’t you notice that big blob of dried food on my face?” He said, “Yeah.” “Why didn’t you tell me?!” And, he said, “I didn’t want to embarrass you.” Anyway, now he’s like the police about my face, saying, “You’ve got a crumb right there!” We’ve been married 51 years! It’s been a long time!\\nUsing Scripture with Your Counselee\\nSecond, you want to teach your counselee what the Scriptures have to teach us about vanity. The Old Testament emphasis is “beauty is vain.” Proverbs 31:30 says, “Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord, she shall be praised.” If you look up the word “vain,” it means futile, worthless, nothing, useless, or mere breath. As you get older, it’s ultimately a losing battle. You do the best with what you have. Psalm 4:2 says, “How long will you love vanity?” The author is not talking about the love of beauty, but about what is worthless or empty. The New Testament emphasis is reflected in 1 Timothy 2:9-10, which says, “Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discretely, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive apparel, but rather by means of good works, as is proper for women making a claim to godliness.”\\xa0By modest and discreet, Paul is saying that her good works and gentle and quiet spirit are her adornment. This is our true beauty in God’s eyes. The woman who loves Him is beautiful.\\nKent Keller and I wrote the book, Modesty: More than a Change of Clothes, and the end of the book has some general suggestions, but it was tempting to just start out on page one: Okay, here’s a list of rules. We didn’t do that because it’s a heart attitude, but most of the styles these days are immodest. They show cleavage, belly buttons, and various and sundry outlines of private parts. We were out to eat in a restaurant, and I noticed this teenage girl. Everybody noticed her. She came in to eat, and I thought, “My goodness! She is practically naked.” Then her mother came in, and I thought, “She IS naked.” I don’t even know how they got in there. She really wasn’t naked, but she may as well have been. I thought, “How sad for that girl that she has that kind of mother.”\\nI want to read you a quote from the book: “If you have a heart that loves God, you will want to please God. According to the Bible, the heart is the part of you that thinks your thoughts, feels your emotions, makes the choices of your will, and lives on after your death. A heart that is concerned about pleasing God will express itself modestly by what you think, do, say, and wear.” It’s not just clothing but what you think, do, say, and wear. “True modesty can only come from someone who is more concerned about showing the world how great God is than how great she is.” True modesty doesn’t come from changing one’s wardrobe. It comes from having one’s heart changed. If you want to be modest (or you could say if you want to be not vain), God must be first in your heart. When you choose to be immodest (or depressed or withdrawn because your body doesn’t look like you want it to), then you’re choosing your own sinful desires over God’s desires, so that He is not first in your life.” The New Testament emphasis regarding vanity is modest clothing, and how you look, how you act, and good works.\\nMost good works are done behind the scenes; few people know about them. This is a woman who quietly works in the kitchen to clean up after the church picnic or she sits by the bed of a friend who’s recovering from surgery. She takes meals to the sick. My daughter had a very serious bout with cancer almost two years ago. Things are going well now, but the outpouring of love was just amazing. People came to clean her house, bring meals, doing just anything that she needed. This woman brings meals to the sick, cleans the house of a woman in her church whose husband is dying. She goes to the nursing home and faithfully visits those from her church and then visits others who don’t have visitors.\\nShe’s like the woman in the Bible named Dorcas in Acts 9 who was full of good works and acts of charity. There was so much grief in the Christian community in Jerusalem when Dorcas died that God used Peter to raise Dorcas from the dead. She reminds me of my friend Patty Thorne who has great joy in serving the Lord through serving others behind the scenes and working hard. Patty truly is the most beautiful woman in this regard. She’s like the holy women of old who hope in God.\\xa0\\nI want to also show you 1 Peter 3:3-4, which says,\\xa0“Your adornment must not be merely the external [so you can have some external adornment], braiding the hair, wearing gold jewelry, or putting on apparel; but it should be the hidden person of the heart, with the imperishable [eternal or unfading] quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God.” Don’t let external adornment\\xa0be your only beauty. Peter could not be saying here that women are forbidden to wear dresses and jewelry. He is saying to not let it be your only beauty, and don’t be ostentatious about it so that you call an inordinate amount of attention to yourself. True beauty is what’s on the inside, a gentle and quiet spirit. Godly women reflect reverence in their behavior by dressing in a manner that is not sensual, provocative, masculine, excessively gaudy, or ostentatious. Instead, their adornment is their good works and their gentle hearts and quiet spirit. The attitude of their hearts, what they’re thinking and desiring, is pleasing to God.\\xa0\\nLet’s talk about a gentle and quiet spirit. I did a huge study on this because it does not mean that you whisper when you talk. It means two things. First, a woman accepts God’s dealings with her as good, even in trials. And second, it means she’s not given to fear or anger. If you put all that together and do a huge study, that’s what you’re going to conclude. This is how biblical counselors would describe in a biblical way what the Christian integrationist would describe in a psychological way.\\nThese women are not grateful for the bodies that they have. The last verse in the 1 Thessalonians 5:18 says to be thankful for all things “for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus.” They’re not content. First Timothy 6:6 says that if we have food and covering, with this we shall be content. They are a lover of self, according to Romans 12:3. Second Timothy 3:2 talks about the last days when men will be lovers of self. Vanity is a lust for beauty. James 1:14-15 says, “But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust (desire).” It’s coming from within us. “Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.” This is a lust for beauty. These counselees could be described as not motivated by a love for God or love for others, but by the love of self and other’s approval. First John 2:15-17 says, “Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is passing away, and also its lust, but the one who does the will of God lives forever.” These are things to teach your counselees, but you need to speak the truth in love. You need to explain; you need to teach them. Talk about the Old Testament emphasis. Talk about the New Testament emphasis. Let God convict them.\\nThird, instead of being jealous, we should be glad for others if they are more beautiful. It’s hard not to hate them, but we have to forgive them for being beautiful. You have to tell yourself, “It’s okay that they’re more beautiful,”\\xa0and thank the Lord for it. First Corinthians 13:4 says that love is not jealous.\\nFourth, learn to accept compliments graciously, believing that the other person was sincere. Do not judge their motives. Philippians 4:8 encourages us to think on things that are lovely, assuming the best about the other person. First Corinthians 13:5 tells us that love is not rude. I know women whose husbands try to compliment them, and they don’t feel pretty, so they just become offended by their husband. Eventually their husbands will quit telling them how pretty they are.\\nFifth, realize that true beauty lies on the inside, not the outside. This is what is precious in God’s sight. Colossians 3:2 says, “Set your mind on the things above…” We need to help our counselees think about God and have an awe of Him. In 1 Peter 2:9 we read, “But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;” This is our purpose. It’s to glorify God and proclaim His excellencies instead of worshipping ourselves and obsessing about ourselves. We can look to Sarah, Abraham’s wife, as an example. The Bible says she was beautiful, but it is also said of her, especially later on in her life, that she adorned herself by being submissive to her husband. Then Peter goes on to describe her as a holy woman who hoped in God. I remember the first time I read the Bible as a new Christian, and I remember reading that verse. I thought, “Lord, make me like that. I want to be a holy one. I don’t want to be old.” She’s a holy woman of old, but now I am old, but I want to be a holy woman who hopes in God. Another example is our Lord Jesus Christ. We know from Isaiah 53:2 that there was nothing about His appearance that we should be attracted to Him. We know from scripture that King David was a handsome man. I wish we could have seen him, maybe we will someday. David wrote about the Lord’s beauty, and he described it as the beauty of His holiness in Psalm 27:4 and 29:2. Don’t you love that?\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are lots of scriptural warnings concerning vanity. Vanity is vain according to Proverbs 31:30. It’s a depressing pursuit and ultimately hopeless. Beauty, says Proverbs 6:25, is one of the ways the adulteress draws her prey. The young man is warned not to seek her beauty in his heart. Jerusalem trusted in her beauty. God had bestowed great splendor on her, and she played the harlot, turning to idols (Ezekiel 16:5). Satan’s heart was lifted up because of his beauty (Ezekiel 28:17).\\xa0\\nTeach your counselees to not be legalistic about dress and makeup. Some people don’t wear any makeup and only drab clothing. And this is dog-ugly! There’s no reason for that. Enjoy the freedom that God has given you; it’s okay to have some external adornment. But some people really think that the plainer and drabber they are, the more pleasing to God they are.\\nThey may be delighting in what Colossians 2 says is self-abasement; that’s asceticism. Colossians 2:23 says, “These are matters which do have the\\xa0appearance of wisdom in\\xa0self-made religion and humility and\\xa0severe treatment of the body,\\xa0but are\\xa0of no value against\\xa0fleshly indulgence.” Outward beauty without inner beauty is a monstrosity. Proverbs 11:22 says, “As a gold ring in a pig’s snout, so is a beautiful woman who lacks moral discretion.” The Bible describes the vain woman as a lover of self, a form of pride in Romans 12:3 and 2 Timothy 3:2. They’re not content, not grateful, have a lust for beauty and are not motivated by love for God and love for others. Exhort her to turn her passion from loving herself and calling attention to herself or avoiding people to a passion for God and serving Him regardless of what she looks like. She must thank God for what she looks like and be grateful no matter what. Encourage her to grow old gracefully in order to leave a legacy for her daughters and the younger women in the church that it was the Lord Jesus who mattered to her. Don’t live as a vain and proud woman but as a living sacrifice to God (Romans 12:1). Vain, proud women can go one of two ways. They can flaunt how they look to call attention to themselves or they can obsess over their body flaws and be depressed and anxious.\\nYou want to teach her a high view of God. Take her through a good study of His attributes such as A.W. Pink’s little book The Attributes of God. I use that a lot. It’s not easy reading there, but the chapters are short. I would tell her every time you get to a Scripture reference that’s cited or even written out, stop reading and look it up in your Bible and think about it. Go back and underline the parts that you stand out to you, that you think are important. Then when she comes back to counseling, we go page by page, and she tells me what stood out to her, and I’ll tell her what stood out to me. You want to teach her the put off and put on concept by having her do a self-talk log, and then coach her on setting her mind on the things above now. I have a website, marthapeacetew.blogspot.com, and I have some free Bible studies on there that you can download and use, such as the salvation worksheets and the sanctification study. Then there’s the put off and put on study. At the end of the studies, if the counselee does the homework, there is a place that asks\\xa0what you know you need to put on and off. This will just make a nice little list that can be your future agendas for counseling.\\xa0\\nTransforming our Thinking\\nI made a chart called Vanity, a Self-Focus versus a Mind Set on the Things Above, a God Focus.\\xa0\\n1. If I could just be ten pounds lighter, then I could be satisfied. Instead, I should think, “I have the freedom in the Lord to diet and lose 10 pounds, but whether I do or not, Father, help me to be like Paul and learn to be content (Philippians 4:11).”\\xa0\\n2.\\xa0 I wonder if that young man noticed me. Instead, I should think, “I’m going to serve the Lord with gladness, whether that young man ever notices me or not (Psalm 100:2).”\\xa0\\n3. I cannot go to church because of the scar on my arm. People will notice. Instead, I should think, “I can go to church, and I will because the Scripture says to. I’m going to go because I love the Lord, and if I have to feel uncomfortable, I will just have to feel uncomfortable (Hebrews 10:25).“\\n4. She was looking at me. She thinks I’m ugly. Instead, I should think, “I have no idea what she’s thinking. Only God knows. I’m going to give her the benefit of the doubt and I’ll smile at her and say ‘Hello.'”\\xa0First Corinthians 4:5 says we are forbidden to judge motives and hidden things. The Lord will do that when He comes back.\\n5. My thighs are misshapen. Instead, I should think,\\xa0“Well, these are the thighs that God gave me. They look like my mother’s. Thank you, God, that no matter what they look like, I’m fearfully and wonderfully made.”\\n6. I hate what I look like. Instead, I should think, “Lord, forgive me for being so self-focused and ungrateful. I’m praising You for what I look like (Psalm 150:6).”\\xa0\\n7. Why did God grace her with such beauty and make me look like this. Instead, I should think, “Lord, I’m glad for her that she’s so pretty, and I’m going to tell her.” Love is not jealous.\\xa0\\n8. I’m too tall. I hate being tall. Instead, I should think, “Lord, thank you for making me tall and giving me life. Help me to focus on showing love to others instead of thinking about myself (Matthew 22:39).”\\xa0\\n9. I can’t stand it when I look in the mirror. Instead, I should think, “Actually, the truth is that I can. Instead of inspecting all my flaws, I’m going to sing a psalm of praise and thanksgiving to God when I look in the mirror (Ephesians 4:19-20).” The person who’s Spirit-filled, meaning controlled by the Spirit, is singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and making melody in her heart to the Lord. I just had cataract surgery this summer, so now I can see a lot better. I can see what I look like a lot better. I used to be kind of hazy and fuzzy, and now I’m like, “Oh my word, I didn’t know I look like that.”\\xa0\\n10.\\xa0 I confess that I check my body flaws many times per day. I even have a particular order—my neck, my hips, my thighs, my ankles, etc.\\xa0 Father, forgive me for being obsessed with my body. Help me to remember when I’m tempted to turn to You in thanksgiving and praise. Psalm 100 says, “Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise.”\\xa0\\n11. I’ve tried to lose weight. Everyone that says I’m too thin, but they’re just trying to be nice. I can see what I look like. Instead, I should think, “They may be right. These are what the Bible calls the wounds of a friend (Proverbs 27:6). They are trying to help me. I will thank them, pray, and ask God to show me, and go to the doctor and let him evaluate whether or not I’m medically too thin.”\\n12. My husband wants to have sex, but I can’t bear to let him see my body. Instead, I should think, “Lord, help me to minister to my husband in this way. Help me to concentrate on pleasing him instead of obsessing about what I look like (1 Corinthians 7:5).“\\n13. A friend said I looked pretty at church, but I know that’s not what she was really thinking. I was rude and unloving when I did not simply and graciously say “Thank you.” Instead, I should think, “Only God can know what she was thinking (1 Corinthians 13:5).”\\xa0\\n14. I cannot afford to have plastic surgery, but I’m going to anyway, and I’m going to charge it. The right thought would be, “I’m reminded that the ‘wicked borrows and does not repay.’ Father, forgive me for thinking such a thing\\xa0(1 John 1:9).”\\xa0\\nConclusion\\nWe do live in a very vain and narcissistic society. You can’t even turn on the news without seeing women dressed inappropriately. We’re just like the Jewish women in Isaiah’s time, the daughters of Zion. We biblical counselors can help our counselees turn from their vanity to setting their minds on the things above. They can learn to be content and actually be beautiful in God’s sight. Let me read again 1 John 2:15-17: “Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the boastful pride of life, is not from the father, but is from the world. The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever.”\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMartha Peace serves at Faith Bible Church, which is located just outside Peachtree City, Georgia, where she teaches ladies’ Bible study classes and counseling classes as well as counsels in the church counseling center.\", 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Understanding Hormones', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 199', 'author': 'Dale Johnson  Dan Dionne', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': 'A lot of people think of hormones as being mysterious, but our whole hormonal system was designed by the Lord.', 'body': 'Dale Johnson:\\xa0This week on the podcast, I am joined by Dr. Dan Dionne. Dr. Dionne is a medical doctor. He graduated from George Washington University School of Medicine. He’s an internal medicine specialist out of Spokane, Washington. He has more than 31 years of experience, particularly in internal medicine. I’m delighted that he’s here with us today to give us some healthy insight on this issue related to hormones. I know this is a question that many of us have. It’s something he thinks about often, but, for the general public, we look at hormones with their impact on the body as being very mysterious as to what we can say are causes, what the effects are on our human body, and the way we respond. These types of issues often come up in counseling, and we want to have a discussion today and allow him to give us some wisdom on some of these things. Dr. Dionne, we’re so glad that you’re here, welcome to the podcast.\\n\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0Thanks Dale. A lot of people do think of hormones as being mysterious, but our whole hormonal system was designed by the Lord. I love that passage in Psalm 139 that says, “For you formed my inward parts, you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works, my soul knows it very well.” God has designed the whole system of hormones to regulate our body’s work and it’s a beautiful thing. That’s exciting and it’s important to remember that it was his design in the first place. A lot of times people do get mystified by hormones and they wonder, “Do I have a hormone imbalance? Are hormones making me behave this way?” Sometimes men are mystified by their wives’ hormones and their daughters’ hormones and what’s going on there.\\nLet me give you a little story if I may. Many years ago, I had a patient who was named Rocky. He was an elder at our church and he was a man’s man. He worked at Kaiser Aluminum and he was a tough guy, but a godly man. One morning, he woke up and he said to his wife, “Ada, I just don’t feel right. I don’t know if I’m having a heart attack or what’s the matter with me, but I just feel really weird.” She said, “Rocky, I want to pray for you today.” That night when he came home, he still felt badly. He wasn’t sure what was going on. She said, “If you still feel this way in the morning then you should call Dan.” They were getting ready to go to bed and he took off his shirt to climb into bed, and she looked over and there was her hormone patch attached to his back and that was the answer. Rocky had been a woman for 24 hours and it just about freaked him out. This shows the power of hormones, what estrogen can do to a man, and how women feel when they have changes in their hormone levels.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0With all that mystery surrounding hormones, the way we think about hormones, and the way it impacts us and we’re not sure how to handle it, what are the particular things that we need to know? How do we relate our understanding of hormones as counselors when we’re discussing the topic of biblical counseling?\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0A lot of times as a biblical counselor, you may have a woman who comes and says, “I think I’m menopausal,” or, “I’m struggling with PMS,” or, “I have lots of emotions around certain times of my cycle.” She’s going to ask those questions and wonder about them, and if you’re not a physician, you’re not in any place to give advice there. The first thing you want to do is ask, “Why don’t you go to your doctor and get checked out to find out what’s going on there?”\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0We understand that hormones are certainly not necessarily impacting just women. When we think about that impact, what would you recommend that a woman do if she comes to a biblical counselor? Obviously, we’re not going to give her medical advice, but as a counselor, we have to give her advice on her emotions in the things that she’s dealing with. What would you recommend that we do?\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0You can ask her to go see her physician. That might be a gynecologist or a family physician or an internist. Say, “Why don’t you ask them, ‘Are my emotions affected by my hormones and could the things that are out of balance be fixed or repaired or improved on?’” Then give her the option to explore that with her doctor.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Say she thinks about that with her doctor. What are the types of things that the counselee should be listening for to know if this is legitimate medical advice that she’s hearing relative to her hormones? Can she know certain tests that are being implemented to check her hormone levels at all by a physician? What are some things that you could advise her on?\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0She should get a good physical exam and she should tell her doctor what her concerns are. For a lot of women, when they get to be in their 50’s, they’re thinking about menopause. The big question would be, “Am I in menopause and am I approaching menopause?” A lot of times, a woman that’s approaching menopause will start to have irregular periods. She’ll have hot flashes. She may not be able to sleep well at night. Quite a few women get depressed when they’re starting to lose estrogen in their bodies. Some of them are sleep deprived and they have trouble even thinking clearly. They can ask their doctor, “Can you check my estrogen levels? Can you check to see if I’m in menopause or getting close?” Then they can start discussing some options.\\nDale Johnson: You just mentioned several symptoms that I think are helpful for us as counselors to pay attention to if a woman is describing these types of issues in this age window. She might not even be thinking about menopause, but we’re hearing her say those things, that she’s having these symptoms, and she’s at this particular age. We may recommend, without her thinking about it, to go and see a physician. That’s wise counsel. As we think about reality and biblical counseling, sometimes we get the rep that we don’t want to discuss bodily issues, but the reality is our body does affect and influence us. How should a woman respond to these legitimate physical changes, these hormonal changes, like menopause? How do we help her to respond appropriately in this type of suffering?\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0I like that you say suffering, because when a woman is going through menopause or suffering from PMS, it is real suffering. As biblical counselors, we all need to have a theology about suffering and how important it is. I love that passage in Psalm 119 where it says, “It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learn your statutes.” God uses suffering in all of our lives to grow us. He uses it with me all the time. I almost don’t learn unless I’m suffering because I’ll go on my little merry way and doing my thing. God uses suffering in that way. A woman could look at her menopausal symptoms as a God-given gift to grow her in her sanctification, but she’ll need to think rightly about that, and that will be hard when she’s suffering.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I’m reminded of 2 Corinthians 4, where Paul is describing to us that our outer man decays as our inner man is being renewed. This can be a scenario, a situation, and a point of suffering that women are called to endure in these particular times. She can be confident that those outer sufferings are not determinative of her inner growth. We can see very healthy growth in her through this process as we deal with these legitimate experiences and emotions that she’s feeling and having. Let me shift gears a little bit because I think this is a great question to ask relative to a relationship that she might be dealing with. Oftentimes, women are quite mysterious to men, anyway.\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0Amen.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0When you think of a situation like menopause or PMS, a man seems to be more mystified in relation to a woman. Let’s think from the husband’s perspective. The wife is confused because he’s not understanding her situation. He’s confused. He likes to disengage. How should a husband support his wife through these types of hormonal problems?\\nDan Dionne:\\xa0It’s in his best advantage or in his best interest to help his wife in this way. You’re right, men do tend to disengage and say, “Oh you just go take care of that, honey, just talk to your doctor about it. Whatever you think is right.” Yet, I think a husband can be a big help to his wife once she has some decisions to make. She might come home from the doctor and the doctor says, “I can put you on this type of estrogen, this type of patch, or we could use these kinds of medications to help you with your symptoms.” He should be involved because he’s going to get to live with her and see how those medications might affect her. He could be a helpful part of the process or he could, again, be checked out and miss that opportunity to be a help to her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'The Bible and the Problem of Hair Pulling', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 130', 'author': 'Heath Lambert  Keith Palmer', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': 'How can we care for someone who struggles with the issue of hair pulling?', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: Our guest this week on the podcast is Dr. Keith Palmer, a fellow with the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors, and a pastor in Granbury, Texas. We’re here to talk with him this week about the problem of hair pulling, and Keith, I think there are a lot of people who would be listening to this and would be surprised to know that when we talk about the problem of hair-pulling, we’re talking about an actual problem. We don’t hear about this every day, explain it to us.\\xa0\\nKeith Palmer: Well, thanks for allowing me to be here. First of all, I was surprised too the first time this issue came my way. As I did research and got to know a little more about it, it was surprising to know that anywhere from two to five percent of the whole population struggle with this issue and all experts agree that that’s low because it’s so under-reported. So, hair-pulling, or it’s sometimes called trichotillomania, or trick, or TTM, is a behavior characterized by sessions where people pull their hair out. The onset is anywhere between 11 and 13 years, and by adulthood, this is very interesting, 80 to 90%, of all people that struggle, are women.\\nSome basic characteristics of the behavior is that there is usually a strong urge or tension that builds up and then that tension is relieved or resolved through the pulling of hair from various parts of the body. There are two main kinds; this is one of the interesting features of it. There is a fully focused version, where the person is very ritualistic, they plan it out, they go through a very prescribed program, and then there’s another version where the person is only semi-focused on it. Almost when you talk to people about it, they’ll describe it as being in a trance or maybe they’re half asleep, even, so they don’t even realize fully what they’re doing. It often occurs during sedentary activities like watching TV, reading, trying to fall asleep at night, sitting in class, trying to do homework, and oftentimes too there’s a search for the perfect hair to pull.\\nSo, the journey, the investigation leading to pulling of the hair is part of the package and once it’s pulled, the individual often examines the hair, chews it, or even ingests the hair and that leads to other medical problems that we’ll talk about. Obviously, bald spots are a big problem with this sort of thing, infections or wounds, and actually, trick is related to skin picking. So, people that pick at their skin, psychologists would understand that as being in the same realm of issues and infections and wounds can happen there. Digestive blockage, if they actually ingest their hair, that can be a medical emergency.\\nThen there are spiritual issues, emotional issues, like shame and guilt, isolation, as they do this privately, depression and anxiety because of dealing with this and thinking about it. They can have peer problems as they don’t want to be around their friends, they don’t want to go out in social context because of how they look; self-image problems. It promotes secrecy avoiding social activities and interference at work and school. The number one issue that I’ve seen in this is just dealing with the shame and embarrassment associated with the behavior.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: You were talking about the search for the hair; help us understand what that search entail? What are people looking for when they’re searching for the hair?\\nKeith Palmer: Usually an imperfection of some degree. They’re looking for one that feels just right, or maybe feels very wrong and that leads them to remove it; it’s very unique to the individual.\\xa0You just have to do a lot of asking questions and listening trying to understand.\\nHeath Lambert: It provides some sort of “fulfillment” to remove it? What would that fulfillment be?\\nKeith Palmer: Well, there’s a physiological thing. First of all, when you pull a hair out of your body, your body reacts to that, so there’s a physiological reaction, but also, when you talk to people that struggle with this, pulling resolves this tension that’s been building up, to pull the hair, at least in some people, and in others, it doesn’t resolve the tension and leads to pulling more and pulling more.\\xa0It is very much specific to the individual; you really have to get to know people and how they particularly struggle with it.\\nHeath Lambert: Are we talking about people pulling one hair, certainly, the search for the right hair would be pulling one here, but are we talking about people grabbing a handful of hair and pulling it out?\\nKeith Palmer: Usually, that’s not how it happens. Usually, it’s one at a time. There is the search comes in trying to find the right one and then we’ll try to find another one. So, it tends to be pulling from the same area of the body, but usually one at a time.\\nHeath Lambert: And that’s where the bald spots come from, correct?\\nKeith Palmer: Correct.\\nHeath Lambert: So, is there a particular area that is popular?\\nKeith Palmer: The scalp would be the number one location. There are others on the body, but the scalp would be the number one.\\nHeath Lambert: Then the ingesting of the hair, are they swallowing one hair at a time or they swallowing a bunch of hair at once? What’s going on?\\nKeith Palmer:\\xa0I believe it varies but what I’ve read and what I’ve experienced in counseling would typically be one at a time and sometimes they ingest the hair, sometimes they’ll just bite part of the hair and then discard it.\\nHeath Lambert: When you’re talking about digestive issues, obviously, your internal organs don’t handle processing hair very well.\\nKeith Palmer: It builds up in your digestive tract and then you could potentially have a blockage and that’s a medical emergency.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: So, I’m listening to you describe this problem that we said at the beginning of the podcast, my guess is, a lot of people would hear that this is a problem and be surprised to find that it’s a problem. After discovering that it’s a problem, I think this is the exact kind of issue that when people say, “surely you don’t think the Bible is about all kinds of counseling, do you”? I think this is the exact kind of issue they’re thinking about. What in the world does the Bible have to say to understand this problem?\\xa0\\nKeith Palmer: It’s a great case study in whether we really believe our theology or not, the sufficiency of Scripture, the adequacy of Scripture. We believe the Bible is the sufficient resource for all counseling problems and this struggle really is no different. There are sufficient resources in the person and work of Jesus and his inspired authoritative Word, to provide answers, both understand the behavior and to minister to those who are struggling. So, the first thing I would say is that pulling hair, picking skin, biting nails, and similar behaviors, are not in and of themselves, moral issues. That’s where the Bible gives us categories to understand, is a behavior a moral issue is an a-moral issue. \\nHowever, in this particular situation, this behavior can become a moral issue in certain circumstances. So, for example, if this behavior becomes a means of dealing with the problems of life against biblical counsel or against God’s instructions, then it becomes a sinful thing to do. For example, many people that struggle with this are dealing with unpleasant feelings, life problems, anger, anxiety, worry, depression, stress, feeling out of control, or even unconfessed sin, and the Bible has a great metaphor for things like that, when we run away from God instead of running to him. I love how the Psalms uses the metaphor of a false refuge, and that’s what this is, this can become a false refuge, a place to run. When we feel out of control, or we feel like our anxiety is overwhelming us, and of course, Psalm 119:8, says that it is better to take refuge in the Lord than, to trust in men or to turn to other false refuges. So that would be one case where this could become a moral issue or a sin issue.\\nAnother circumstance that could become a moral issue would be when the behavior becomes enslaving, and that’s exactly what we usually see with a behavior like this. 1 Corinthians 6:12 says, “all things are lawful for me. Not all things are profitable. All things are lawful for lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything”. Of course, that’s not unique to this issue, but this struggle tends to become a master. People become enslaved to it. It is at that point the Bible would say, okay, now this is becoming a moral issue and we need to think about spiritual resources to change. \\nA third situation where this issue could become a moral issue, a spiritual issue is when the behavior damages your body. 1 Corinthians goes on to tell us that a believer’s body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and we’ve been bought with a price, and therefore, we should glorify God in our body. So, not always, but in many cases, people are damaging their body; bald spots that take months, even years to recover or if they’re getting infections, if they’re picking their skin, digestive problems, if they’re ingesting the hair. So, if it’s damaging their body, we would say, “that’s not honoring to the Lord”, and we need to repent and see grace to change.\\xa0\\nA final way, where this could become a real moral issue is if the behavior leads to or feeds other behaviors that are overtly sinful in some way. So, for example, a failure to love neighbor because I’m too embarrassed to go out and minister to my brother or sister. So, a situation like that. Another thing the Bible teaches about this, and I call it front-end issues and back-end issues, there are usually clear spiritual issues that lead to a person engaging in this behavior and the Bible would speak to that. We’ve talked about some of those already anxiety, stress, worry, wanting control, things like that, but they’re also backend issues, things that come as a result of this behavior. So that would be the shame, the guilt, the secrecy, the lying, and deceit, enslavement; trick can lead to difficult emotions, and further, sinful behavior. Now, in some cases, people that struggle with this may not be able to point to a precipitating issue, but nonetheless, they deal with those back-end issues in the Bible is full of answers for those spiritual issues.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: So, you have just mentioned, a whole big bunch of things going on, just a wealth of resources that when you look at this with sort of biblical lenses, you’re going to have all sorts of ways to understand what’s going on. What does the Bible have to say about helping with this problem? I can imagine that’s going to be very specifically related to what’s going on with the issue that leads to this problem, but what are some ideas you could give us about things the Bible has to say to help?\\nKeith Palmer: I think the first priority is just to be a loving biblical friend. Proverbs says a friend loves at all times, right? This is a behavior that is full of shame, full of embarrassment, and most people are not going to talk about it. Okay, so building the type of relationship, that true, biblical friendship that we see in the book of Proverbs, to where I might become the type of person that if there’s somebody struggling with this, they would want to trust me enough to tell me what’s going on. So, I think being a good, caring, biblical friend has to be the first thing. As a subset of that, the onset of this behavior is typically in childhood, so I think parents particularly need to be very careful how they react to this sort of situation; when a parent freaks out and overreacts, “I can’t believe what you’re doing that, why would you do that? That’s so weird”. Exceedingly, unhelpful, and adds to the shame and embarrassment that the child already feels. So when James tells us to be quick to hear, slow to speak, I think that’s a great counsel for parents that are helping their children with this sort of thing. Listening and understanding is key to helping and parents need to be committed to that and then respond in godly ways.\\xa0\\nSo, another way that we can help in this situation is to build a Biblical framework for understanding it. I think most people would hear of this issue and say, “the Bible has nothing to say about this”, and that’s one of the things I love about being a biblical counselor is an opening God’s Word and saying, “let’s see the answers here, let’s see the heart issues behind this”, and that’s one off the joys in counseling, putting the counselee in the framework of the Bible and then the Bible comes alive with enhancers at that point. \\nA third way would be to address those issues, those spiritual issues that we’ve talked about both front-end and back-end. The Bible teaches us how to deal with guilt, shame, anger, depression, anxiety, fear, lying, isolation, and sometimes issues that are discovered in counseling really go from a person’s past. So recognizing that there was a hurt, a struggle, and this became a way to deal with that, a false refuge, like the way the Psalms describes it, and we need to help unpack what that is and lead them to take refuge in the Lord.\\nI love this verse in Hebrews. It says that Jesus has been tempted in all things as we are and yet without sin. When I’m ministering to somebody, I can say to them on the basis of this Word, “Jesus knows what it feels like to have strong, urges, strong temptation to sin and so he can relate to you. You can go to Him, and He is a sympathetic high priest and yet He was without sin”. The text goes on to say, “So we go boldly to his throne of grace, to find mercy and grace to help in our time of need”. So, help your counselor to turn to the Man of Sorrows who’s experienced the weight of temptation and to find that grace to say “no” to those ungodly desires. Then maybe a fourth way we could help is to help the counselee to develop very practical prevention and temptation strategies and we can develop that based on the individual and the things that we discover, but basically, Jesus tells us in Matthew 5, “remove any hindrance that’s leading you to temptation”. So, when you get to know a person’s situation, what are one of those things? Is it isolation? Is it a certain situation? Is it a context or a behavior and activity? If we can remove that or change those things, that helps to prevent the strength and the weight of temptation.\\xa0\\nFinally, one last way to help would be to help the counselee to grow in the normal means of grace. There may be many people that can’t relate to this, and yet, the answers the Bible gives are the same answers for any problem in life. Growing in the Word of God, growing in prayer, growing in dependence, the local church, and involvement in corporate worship, private worship I think, in this case, the best defense really is a good offense. Psalm. 119 says, “how can a young man keep his way, pure? By keeping it according to your Word”, and then it says this, “with all my heart I have sought you”. We want to train people to see God with all their heart and as they grow in grace they will see those resources come to resist the temptation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKeith Palmer serves as an ACBC Fellow, Board Member, and associate pastor of Grace Bible Church in Granbury, TX.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'The Importance Of Sleep', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 127', 'author': 'George Sanders  Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': 'What does sleep have to do with biblical counseling?', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: I’m honored this week on the podcast to be joined by Dr. George Sanders, an ACBC certified counselor and a board-certified Medical Doctor in Southern California. We are happy to have you, Dr. Sanders, and to talk about a very important topic that I bet a lot of people don’t realize is as important as it is; it’s the topic of sleep and the importance of getting a good night’s sleep. Why is it important for somebody to do that?\\nGeorge Sanders: You know, they say that the world is run by tired men and women, so I suspect that they need to be listening this morning. Why is sleep important? Well, for one thing, it allows us to repair and revitalize our bodies. In our brains, there’s a substance called adenosine and when that substance is charged up, it becomes ATP, which is the energy molecule that our brain uses. As we are growing tired, as a day passes, more and more adenosine is accumulating in our brain and sleep allows us to recharge that into ATP, and that sort of clears away the fog in our brain. So that’s an adenosine fog that you’re experiencing as you grow tired as the day passes. \\nAlso, growth hormone is produced at night when we’re sleeping. So that our mothers probably knew what they were talking about when they said, “if you don’t sleep, it will stunt your growth.” Also, sleep prevents and heals diseases. If you sleep under six hours a night, you are four and a half times more likely to come down with a cold in a particular week than someone who sleeps over seven hours. Also, someone sleeping under six hours has an increased mortality over someone who is sleeping seven hours and more. We see the sovereignty of God in that, but just in terms of what science tells us, these things are true. Also, sleep aids in memory and learning. It used to be thought that our brain cells or neurons really didn’t change much as the years went by, but we now know that’s not true. They changed significantly, their connections change, and sleep aids in that process and that particular process is very important for memory for learning. So for all those reasons, sleep is vitally important. In fact, If you do not sleep as a human, you will die; it’s that important.\\nHeath Lambert: It’s so important. We need it, but a lot of people don’t get it. Why is it that so many people don’t get a good night’s rest.?\\xa0\\nGeorge Sanders: There are six major sleep disorders that we can characterize, the most common is insomnia. Insomnia is when you can’t fall asleep or when you can’t stay asleep, either waking up in the middle of the night or you can’t sleep late enough in the morning to get an adequate amount of refreshment. Also, there is sleep apnea, where you will awake hundreds of times per night because you’re basically stopping breathing. So, even though you may stay in bed for 10 hours, you’re not getting an adequate amount of quality sleep. So, it’s not only quantity, but it’s also quality of sleep. There’s also restless leg syndrome, where your legs are either painful at night, you move them around, that makes them feel better, or you just lie down at night and your legs feel like they need to need to move and that can be very disruptive to your sleep as well as to the sleep of the person who happens to be next to you. There are circadian rhythm disorders, things that have to do with your body’s internal clock. Say, you’re alternating working nights and working days, or if you’re traveling to a different time zone, that’s going to foul up your sleep as well.\\nThere are things called parasomnias, things like sleepwalking, sleep talking, or even bedwetting. The sixth major category is narcolepsy and this doesn’t have to do with not enough sleep but it’s too much sleep, being sleepy during the day.\\nSo all of these six categories are categories in which people are having problems with sleep. Insomnia, about 60% of people have insomnia to some degree, about 10% with sleep apnea, and about 10% with restless leg syndrome. So, you can see, as you start to add up those numbers, you’ve got a very, very significant part of the population of this country who are having sleep problems.\\nHeath Lambert: So, we want to address those problems. There’s people listening to this right now who have sleep problems. What would we say, as people who are committed to the Scriptures, what would we offer someone with sleep problems that’s better than they could get somewhere else?\\nGeorge Sanders: Well, the sleep disorders that we spoke about, sleep apnea, you treat that with a mask. Restless leg syndrome, narcolepsy, you treat with medication. But when it comes to insomnia, insomnia is really the area where both secular psychologists and biblical counselors tend to focus, and the major cause of insomnia is stress and worry. Now, if you are a secular counselor or a secular physician you might say, “Okay, well, this person needs to be on sleeping medication”, or maybe they would send the person for cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of insomnia, CBT-I, those are both popular and they worked to some degree, but as biblical counselors, we have a great deal more to offer, something that I like to call biblical sleep therapy. It’s not so much a program as it is a worldview if you will.\\xa0It’s a way of life and it would involve a series of four things. \\nFirst of all, you need to have a biblical mindset. You just seek wisdom, God’s wisdom, which is found ultimately in Christ and contained within Scripture. You need to guard your thought life; stay away from the violent movies from things that are going to produce troubling thoughts. You need to pray in a grateful way, Philippians 4:6 tells us that we are to be anxious for nothing and everything, and with prayer and supplication, let your requests be made known to God and that God will guard your mind. He will basically take away your anxiety, which is certainly going to produce sleep.\\nSo,\\xa0a biblical mindset and also a fear of God. God is on the throne, and if God is on the throne and if He is in control of all things, then why are we anxious about it? The third one would be obedience, obedience to the Scripture. We have a conscience and our conscience is an active force in our lives. If we are disobedient, we’re going to be troubled by our conscience and a troubling conscience is certainly an impediment to a sound night’s sleep. Fourthly. We need to be content. We shouldn’t covet another person has we shouldn’t lust for things that we don’t have, shouldn’t wish for things that are not ours. God will provide what we need. If you combine those four things, you’re going to have what I like to call, Biblical Sleep Therapy.\\xa0\\nHowever, if you read the Psalms, many times, the psalmist is not sleeping at night. But what does the psalmist say? “Oh my goodness gracious. This is a terrible thing”, no. The psalmist says this is an opportunity for examination, for me to look at my own life, to look at my heart. Am I right before the Lord? The psalmist says, ‘”try me, O Lord and know me, you know, my secret faults. Point these things out to me.” Also, you would want to take time for meditation. Meditation on the Scripture at night, it’s quiet, there’s no one else around. What a wonderful opportunity to meditate on Scripture. Perhaps you’ve read something before you went to bed that night in Scripture, what a great opportunity to meditate upon it and also a wonderful opportunity for prayer, both for yourself, as well as for others.\\xa0\\nSo, if you find yourself having gone through a sleepless night or at least a night without adequate refreshment, you’re going to say, “you know, that night was not wasted, I was able to profit from it”. So if you combine those four things and then understand it, even if we’re not sleeping well that there is profit to be had from it. In fact, the psalmist often speaks of how God held his eyes open so that he would have opportunity to examine to meditate to pray. Then we have a very powerful weapon in our arsenal, as we seek to comfort those Christians who are having difficulty with sleep.\\nHeath Lambert: I am so encouraged to hear you say that because it just underlines that those problems are common to all man, and probably a lot of people laid in bed last night and they just thought, “oh, there’s nothing to be done”. I am so thankful for the wisdom of Scripture that says, “Hey, the Bible has stuff to say about your sleep”. That’s just so encouraging. We’re glad you’re here with us.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorge Sanders is an ACBC certified counselor, a lay elder at Grace Community Church, and sits on the board of directors of The Master’s University and Seminary.

      "{'title': 'Helping People With Hallucinations', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 125', 'author': 'George Sanders', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': 'Scripture helps people with hallucinations by focusing them on the truth.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: I’m honored this week to be joined on the podcast by Dr. George Sanders, an ACBC certified member and a medical doctor in Southern California, and we’re talking about this issue of hallucinations, and how to think of them from a Christian and a biblical perspective. Dr. Sanders, we are really glad that you’re here and serving us in this way. I want to begin by just asking you, what is a hallucination?\\xa0\\nGeorge Sanders: Hallucinations are very simply sensations that seemed to be real, but that are created in the mind. For example, your hearing, you might hear voices, or you might see things that are not real. You might even smell the taste things that aren’t real, or you may feel things crawling on your skin but when you look down, there’s nothing there. Hallucinations can be caused by a variety of things. First of all, most people who have hallucinations are without any type of disease, about 10% of all of us have hallucinations at some point in our lives. There are, of course, medical reasons for hallucinations. If you have Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, you may have hallucinations. If you have a seizure disorder or if you’re withdrawing from alcohol, you may have hallucinations.\\nCertainly, all of us think of LSD and certain types of mushrooms as producing hallucinations and mental illness, whether it be schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. They say that up to 80% of schizophrenics have auditory, that is auditory hallucinations, they hear voices or visual hallucinations.\\xa0So those are the categories into which people would fall who have hallucinations.\\nHeath Lambert: I’m talking to people all over the country and all over the world, and they would point to a problem like that, a hallucination, a potentially serious problem, and they would say it’s exactly this kind of problem that makes biblical counseling dangerous. They would say that the Bible just can’t understand these kinds of really serious problems and that if you come at people like that with the Bible, you’re going to make things worse. So, let’s talk about hallucinations and the Bible. What does Scripture have to say to help us understand this phenomenon?\\xa0\\nGeorge Sanders: Well, if you look in in the Bible, and I’ve done that in my life, my particular translation, nowhere is the word “hallucination” mentioned. There is a particular translation though, of Proverbs 23, I believe it’s verse 33, that speaks of the person who drinks a great deal as seeing things that are not real. So that is probably referring to someone who has a problem with alcoholism, and they are seeing things, which we know of course is indeed true. Some people would say, “well, you know, whenever the 12 disciples saw Jesus appeared to them, that was a hallucination.” Well, we know, of course, that is not true, because Jesus was seen by 12 people at the same time on that occasion, and you don’t have hallucinations in people’s minds going on simultaneously, and He was also seen by people, a large number of people in Galilee. So that of course is not the case.\\xa0\\nOther people would point Saul when he was on the Damascus Road, right? There was the bright light, but that wasn’t hallucination because Christ did appear to Paul at that time. So again, we don’t see hallucinations in Scripture, but that doesn’t mean that Scripture doesn’t have something to say about how you care for someone with hallucinations.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Okay. So, let’s turn the corner then and talk about how can we understand the Scriptures to draw near to somebody who’s experiencing this problem.\\nGeorge Sanders: Well, the type of person who’s going to come to you as a counselor with hallucinations, is someone who’s having problems with hallucinations. It’s not just a pretty light that shining or something of that type, it’s something significant; these tend to be auditory hallucinations, the types of things where you’re hearing voices that are telling you to hurt yourself or hurt someone else that are derogatory, that are perhaps even screaming at you.\\xa0\\nThese types of hallucinations are seen in people who are suffering from conditions like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. So, they would come to you with hallucinations.\\xa0\\nNow, many of these people are on drugs already and the drugs are effective, in many cases, in reducing hallucinations, but they don’t always eliminate them. So again, we always would want to point people to Scripture. We would say, let’s think about the character of God. God is a good God. Let’s talk about the fact you are in Christ, that is your relationship as a believer. You are in Christ. Let’s also talk about the types of things that Scripture tells us that we are to do. We are to love our neighbor as ourselves. So, if someone were to say to you, “I think the FBI is following me”, to point out, “Okay, why are we concerned about this, because Psalm 23 points out that the Lord is your Shepherd, He’s going to care for you, not only on this Earth but in eternity future”, or if the person says you, “these voices are telling me that I should go and kill this person”.\\nWe then point out that as a believer, we know that we are to be obedient to the things of God, to God’s law, and we know that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves.” So even though hallucinations and schizophrenia, and these things may have a significant medical component, just like every other medical illness, there is a place for biblical counseling because these are hurting people in need and Scripture has something to say to everyone in a situation like that.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: So my father-in-law who had Parkinson’s disease for 27 years, he’s in heaven now, he died just within the last eight months but was a dear and a precious and a Godly Man, and his body was just ravaged by the disease of Parkinson’s and throughout the last 10 years of his life as they were moving his medication around and tweaking it to try to keep him mobile, he would experience hallucinations. I can remember when our first son was born and he and his wife came to our home, to be with us, to just help us get adjusted to life with this new baby. They had just changed his medication and he was having hallucinations. It was really serious. He came to me, he got on his knees, and in tears, he was telling me that he was seeing gun men through the window walking around outside and he said, “Heath, please get Lauren and Carson out of here,” so here is this man who loves his daughter, loves his grandson, and he is desperate that his son-in-law protect these people and, you know, I just got down on the floor with him and I just told him, “Tony, I love you. I’m telling you, there’s nothing out there. I want to do what I can to protect Lauren and Carson and if there was something out there, I would do it, but that’s just not the truth.”\\xa0\\nWe talked about Philippians 4:8 and thinking on what’s true, and I said, “you can trust me, I wouldn’t tell you something that’s not so, and you trust the Lord even more than me. He’s going to protect us.”\\xa0What happened over the years, first of all, they were trying to tweak his medication too, but I can remember a couple of years later he came into the living room and he said, “did you just bug your eyes out at me”?, and I said, “no, I didn’t”. He said, “okay, I didn’t think so. I’m just trying to think on what’s true,” and I just thought that is a powerful illustration of the Spirit of God overcoming even very powerful medications in this man’s body. It is so true that a believer can think on what’s true and obey the Lord, with the Spirit’s help, even when there are these powerful physical forces working against us?\\nGeorge Sanders:\\xa0Absolutely. The thing with Parkinson’s disease, as opposed to schizophrenia where the hallucinations are a part of the actual illness, with Parkinson’s, is almost always the medications themselves, so generally, with better management of the medication, you can eliminate the hallucinations, but that doesn’t mean that the person isn’t suffering from them. What they have is an alternate reality in their mind and if they’re hearing those voices and if they are giving way to them, they’re choosing to believe something that’s false. \\nReality is God’s reality and we need to point them to that, Philippians 4:8, whatever is true, noble, just, pure, lovely, good report, if there’s anything virtuous or praiseworthy, meditate on these things. We’re called upon consistently in Scripture to put off and put on and we are new creatures in Christ; our minds are to be renewed. We can put on the mind of Christ. So, we would encourage a person in the grace that the Lord has provided to us, prayer, reading of Scripture, meditation on Scripture, and again, a vibrant relationship with the Lord. These will go a long way toward minimizing the disruptive influence of these hallucinations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorge Sanders is an ACBC certified counselor, a lay elder at Grace Community Church, and sits on the board of directors of The Master’s University and Seminary.

      "{'title': 'Body Image and Your Spouse', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 113', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': \"We live in a culture of comparison. A person doesn't have a body image problem, but a body comparison problem.\", 'body': 'Heath Lambert: One of the questions that we have received here lately at ACBC concerns how to minister to your spouse when your spouse has body image concerns. And when we talk about body image, we’re talking about difficulties with the way they perceive themselves. They look at themselves and find themselves to be ugly or too fat or too thin or whatever it is. And that can create a real set of tensions not only in the mind and the heart of the person who’s struggling with the concerns but also in the relationship between the person who struggles with concerns and their spouse. And the question is, how do we deal with that in marriage? And so, we’re going to talk about that this week on the podcast and how to think about and minister to your spouse that may be struggling in this area. And what I want to do is mention just four things that you could keep in mind as you try to deal with this situation.\\nAnd here’s the first one. We need to be honest about a culture of comparison. So, we live in a culture where most people compare themselves to other people. A person doesn’t so much have a body image problem but has a comparison problem. A person who was alone on a deserted island and never saw another human being would not have a body image problem. But as soon as you place yourself in a culture with advertising, with movies, with pornography, as soon as you place yourself in that world, you start this problem of comparison. And it’s not about what I look like so much as about what I look like over and against what he looks like or what she looks like. And so, we need to be honest that we do live in this culture of comparison, and we need to be honest about a few things within that culture. First of all, everybody gets older. This is the way it is. You can’t stop it. This is the curse of humanity that our bodies grow old and eventually, we die. And that getting older means wrinkles happen, muscle tone weakens, your body spreads, your organs get weak. Everybody gets older and your appearance changes and there’s nothing you can do about it. In fact, even the people who try to spend loads of money to stop it wind up at a certain point looking ridiculous. And so, there’s nothing you can do to stop the advance of age and its effect on your appearance. That’s the first thing we need to be honest about.\\nThe second thing we need to be honest about in this culture of comparison is that everybody looks different. God did not make one body type. He didn’t make one hair color. He didn’t make one eye color. He didn’t make one nose shape. He didn’t make one height. He made everybody different. Everybody looks a little bit different. And we undermine the integrity of God as the Creator when we try to mandate one physical appearance as the norm or as the beautiful one. As a matter of fact, we need to honor the Lord in this issue by honoring His creative expression, if you want to call it that, and His Creator’s rights to design human beings exactly the way, and in all the different kinds of ways, that He has designed them. And so, everybody looks different and since everybody who looks different is made in the image of God, then that means everyone’s beauty is found in their creation by God and not in the fact that they might look different than somebody else, in fact, that’s the point.\\nA third thing we need to be honest about is that nobody meets the cultural standard of beauty. In this cultural comparison that we live in where there is a certain kind of beauty that’s held out, nobody meets that standard. Here’s what I mean by that. Even the people that you look at in magazines, even the people that you see on television, in the people that you might be, though you shouldn’t be, looking at in pornography, nobody meets that standard. I read an article several years ago about all of the work that has to go into making models look the way models look. They have to starve themselves to death in some situations. They have to endure hours of makeup and chemical treatments. They have to endure surgery. And then after all that, they put their picture on the magazine, and then they have to be airbrushed to get the quote-unquote imperfections removed from their skin. This is the case in any kind of public presentation, whether it’s a magazine model, a movie, or whatever. The point is even the models that we’re looking at they don’t look that way naturally. It takes a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of money, and then they’re going to get older too. Nobody can keep up with this and nobody looks like the standard. It’s all a lie. It’s all a presentation. And we need to be honest that as soon as we enter into this culture of comparison we enter into an unattainable reality and even the people who we hold out as the ideal can’t reach it.\\nHere’s a second reality we need to think about, remember, and talk about, and that is you should, as you’re married to somebody who struggles with these things, you should encourage all kinds of things in your spouse. Since nobody meets the ideal, since everybody looks different, and since everybody gets older, beauty is going to fade. Beauty is going to be this transitory thing in the physical sense. And so, you need to encourage all kinds of things in your spouse. One of the errors that people can make in this regard when they hear that their wife is struggling or their husband is struggling is they will sort of hyper encourage. “Oh, you look so good. There’s nobody prettier than you are.” And it’s all about their body or even about their sexual performance. I’m not saying there’s not a time and a place to encourage in that regard and you should encourage your spouse that you think they are pretty, you should encourage your spouse that you think he, or she, is pleasing to you, but you have to be careful that you not underline a negative reality, lust, a sinful desire in their heart, by only focusing on their appearance and only focusing on realities that might be sexual. You should work to encourage your spouse’s godliness. You should work to encourage your spouse’s parenting. You should work to encourage what a great friend they are. You should be looking for areas where they’re tender and kind and say, “You know, that’s so wonderful when you do that. I’m so glad to see you doing that. I’m so glad to see that in you.” You don’t want to get into the trap of thinking that you can correct the body image problem with your own personal encouragement. In fact, that can narrow the focus in their life and you want to help remind them that you’re more than a person who looks a certain way, you’re a parent, you’re a follower of Christ, you’re a friend, you’re my spouse, and I love it when you’re nice to me, and I love it when you take me out to dinner or prepare a meal for me, or whatever it is that you do. And so, encourage all kinds of things in your spouse and don’t fall into the trap of focusing on that one area.\\nHere’s the third reality. You have to pursue purity. If you are married to someone who struggles with their body image, one of the most important things that you can do is to pursue purity in your own heart and put to death any desire for any person that is not your spouse. In Proverbs 5:18 this is what the Bible says, “Let your fountain be blessed and rejoice in the wife of your youth. A loving deer, a graceful doe, let her breasts satisfy you at all times; be exhilarated always with her love. Why should you, my son, be exhilarated with an adulteress and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?” The point here is that the author of Proverbs is saying you are supposed to be attracted to your wife. You’re not supposed to be to somebody else’s wife. You’re not supposed to be attracted to somebody you’re not married to. You’re supposed to be attracted to the person you are married to. This means whatever your spouse looks like is your type. Sometimes, people say, “What’s your type?” and they’ll give this description and it’s a reflection of the culture of comparison. In the biblical worldview, your type is whatever your spouse looks like and you are called to put to death the desires for any other kind of person. When you are pursuing purity and you are focused on, as this text says, delighting in your spouse’s physical appearance, desiring in the body of your spouse, when that is what you desire, that is what you will be grateful to receive. When you’re entertaining desires for other things, however, that’s when you’ll be disappointed, when your spouse presents you his or her body and you’re going to feel let down. So, the reality is you need to pursue purity. Sometimes our spouses struggle with body image issues because we have nurtured an impure heart and are really secretly or not so secretly desiring something other than the good gift that the Lord has given us. And so, you need to pursue purity.\\nAnd then finally, you need to emphasize gratitude. You need to do this in your own heart, it’s related to what I was just saying about pursuing purity, you need to be grateful for what the Lord has given you. The body of your spouse is God’s gift to you and you need to be grateful for it. And as you overflow in gratitude for God’s good gift to you, you need to help your spouse who struggles be grateful to God for what He has given them. The reality is the bodies we’ve received are God’s gift to us and at some point, somewhere in their heart, a spouse who is struggling with body image issues is failing to be grateful for the gift of the body they’ve received from God. And so, this makes the issue one of gratefulness in their heart to God. We need to encourage our spouses who struggle to be grateful to the Lord for all that they have received. And as soon as you’re aware of that, then you’re aware that this is an issue of the heart that requires Jesus. Gratitude is spiritual fruit that we need the Spirit of Jesus to produce. So, the most important thing we’re going to do with the spouse who struggles with body image issues is to point them to Jesus Christ. To point them that Jesus has done what is important. He has forgiven us our sin. He has made entrance available to us into eternal life. He will glorify our bodies so that even where our bodies fail because of a world stained by sin Jesus is going to make all that right. He won’t make all of us the same, but He’ll make it all wonderful. And then we need to look to Him and depend on Him and ask Him for His forgiveness where we’ve failed to be grateful for the good gift of a body He has given, and we need to ask Him to fill our hearts with gratitude for that good gift. And so, ultimately the solution to a body image issue is to look to Jesus Christ and to be found in Him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Why You’ll Never Lose Weight This Year', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 84', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Body 14', 'question': \"The reason that many don't lose weight is because they ignore the spiritual side of this issue.\", 'body': 'Heath Lambert: We’re here at the beginning of the year where so many people are making New Year’s resolutions. And for so many people, those New Year’s resolutions involve a commitment to lose weight this year. And for so many of you who’ve made resolutions, it is not going to happen. I want to tell you on this podcast why it’s not going to happen. But before I tell you why it’s not going to happen, you need to understand that some of you listening to this should not lose weight this year. You should put it out of your mind. Some of you have physical issues that make it impossible for you to lose weight. Some of you have physical issues that make it very unwise for you to think about losing weight. Some of you have spiritual issues, where you’re not thinking about food properly, and you need to deal with that before you deal with your actual weight.\\nThe reality is that the Bible speaks about weight and weight loss and weight gain from a completely different perspective than we do in our contemporary western society. We actually addressed that topic on a podcast last year at this time. I’d encourage you to go listen to that to think more carefully and more biblically about how weight loss fits in with an overall vision that the Bible portrays about food. For so many of you listening to this, self-control in your eating is a problem. It’s an issue. You eat more than you should even though God made food to be received with gratitude. In your life, gratitude has morphed into gluttony, and you have a problem. And the reality is that when we lose self-control with regard to food and we become gluttonous, it becomes problematic and many different ways. First of all, there’s the sin problem that we need to deal with before the Lord since gluttony is a sin, but also getting to an unhealthy weight creates all sorts of physical problems. High cholesterol creates all sorts of physical problems. There’s also the expense of it. You have to continually buy more clothes, it can create all kinds of problems from your pant size to your heart issues. And so, we need to be is that a lack of self-control with regard to food can cause many problems, and it’s often very wise for so many of us to consider how to be more self-controlled and therefore lose weight this year.\\nAnd so many of us are going to make the commitment to eat less and lose weight, and we will not make it. We won’t keep it, we’ll either plateau or we will gain weight in spite of ourselves, and I want you to understand this week on the podcast why that is the case. The reason you will not lose weight but gain weight or stay the same this year is because you will treat your issues with food like they are a physical issue when really they are a spiritual issue.\\nIf your issue is with self-control, where gratitude has morphed into gluttony, there’s something you need more than calories and how exercise works, and that is you need repentance before the living God. There’s actually a text in Scripture that talks about this, even though the idea of weight loss isn’t mentioned. It is 2 Corinthians 7:10-11, and it says, “for godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment at every point you’ve proved yourselves innocent in the matter”. The reality is this text explains to you why you won’t lose weight this year –it has to do with the spiritual issue of repentance.\\nThe text talks about two different kinds of sorrow. There is godly sorrow, which leads to life, and there’s worldly sorrow, which leads to death. Worldly sorrow is sorrow over the things of the world – you’re sad over losing things that the world offers. Godly sorrow is sadness over losing the favor of God with regard to the sin in your life. Worldly sorrow doesn’t work –it leads to death because the logic of the sorrow is the same logic that led to the sin in the first place. We sin because we want to do things that make us happy and we don’t care if they honor the Lord or not. The worldly sorrow is also about us. We have lost benefits that we want to experience in our life. And so, sin and worldly sorrow are both about us, they have us at the center of it. So for so many people, weight loss is about worldly sorrow, you eat, as much as you want for, as long as you want and then you don’t like the way you look. And so, you decide you’re going to eat less. But then, once you’re looking at the cake or you’re looking at the third helping of scalloped potatoes, you want what’s going to make you happy in that moment. You don’t have godly sorrow –you haven’t transitioned from having your eating be about you to having your eating be about the Lord. That’s the very definition of worldly sorrow. And the Bible says you need to repent.\\nIf your issue is one of self-control, you can join any weight loss program you want to join, but your heart is not right. You have it oriented your heart towards the Lord. And so when the chips are down, you’re going to keep doing the things that make you happy, and in the moment of temptation with food, you’re going to go to food every time. So what you need to do is spend less time online trying to find the weight loss deal that’s being offered right now at the beginning of the year and spend time in the word on your face before Christ, asking Him to forgive you for your lack of self-control and asking Him to give you the grace to say no to food, when it tempts you away from that self-control. Jesus Christ will give you grace to help in those moments of temptation. If you come to Him in a spirit of trust, in a spirit of faith, the text here is not just helpful in telling us what’s wrong with our attitude, but it tells us several things that we can do to help ensure that a sense of godly sorrow, a sense of true repentance is in place.\\nWe actually don’t have time on the podcast this week to talk about all of the elements in 2 Corinthians 7:11 that would characterize godly sorrow or true repentance. Let me just mention for the sake of time, two, as they relate to our food and to our self-control. And to the right desire, that many of us would have to lose weight this year. The first idea that I’ll mention is this idea in 2 Corinthians 7:11 that says godly sorrow is characterized by an eagerness to clear yourself. This is the idea that when we are truly sorrowful in a godly way that leads to repentance over our sin, then we will want to clear ourselves from the sin, and will want to do whatever we have to do to get away from the opportunity to sin. It’s the biblical idea of making no provision for the flesh.\\nWhen we’re truly sorrowful in a godly way, when we’re truly repentant, we’re going to want to get away from temptation. This is going to mean a lot of things with regard to food, weight loss, and self-control, but a couple of things that it might mean is that you have to go through your house and you have to eliminate from your pantry and from your fridge tempting foods that would lead you away from a spirit of self-control. It might mean that. It will certainly mean that you have to go into this with an accountability partner. You have to have somebody in your life that knows about the struggle, that knows about the desire you have to be more self-controlled, and you need to talk with them openly, and honestly. Hear from them. Learn from them, and receive their rebuke. When you’re not self-controlled, be honest with them when you’re tempted and so get help from a brother or sister in Christ. There’s another element in the text that helps us understand what godly sorrow would look like with regard to weight loss and self-control and that’s one of the last one that’s mentioned where it says, what punishment!\\nGodly sorrow. True repentance is characterized by punishment now. What does this mean? This can be confusing to people who don’t understand the context. What the Apostle Paul is talking about is that when we’re truly sorrowful in a godly way, we receive the punishment for our sin. We receive all of the consequences that are necessarily entailed in what we have done wrong. This is so important for people who are trying to employ self-control with regard to their eating habits because we get hungry and we don’t like the feeling of hunger, or we get desire for that piece of cherry pie or for the doughnut or for the carb with gravy on it. We get the desire for those things –and those things are good. I’m not trying to say that the food is bad, but the problem is in our heart where we can’t say no. We have a self-control problem. We get this desire and saying no to the desire feels bad, we don’t want the consequences that come with being in the habit of not exercising self-control. And so we dive in and we eat the donut or three and we eat the gravy and we do all the things that we’ve done because we don’t like the consequences of saying no. What we need to understand is that’s an indication that our heart is not right before the Lord with regard to self-control.\\nIf we’re going to be self-controlled, if we’re going to have the fruit of self-control, then it will be paired with the fruit of joy. Self-control that has anger and bitterness is not real self-control. It’s just fleshy saying no. We need to pursue joy as we say no to tempting things that would lead us into sin because our hearts are happy when we honor the Lord Jesus Christ. For so many people listening to this, you will not lose weight this year. And the purpose of this podcast is not to gloat over that but to help you early in the year see why that’s the case. And for so many of us, it’s a spiritual reason that has to do with our hearts before the Lord. We’re characterized by worldly sorrow that’s more obsessed with us than the things of God and we don’t do the practical things we need to do to pair our commitment to Christ with actual practical change. And so my prayer for you is that whether you need to eat less or whether you need to eat more or whether you need to spend less or whether you need to be more generous, that you will be characterized by self-control you’ll be characterized by godly sorrow, rather than worldly sorrow, and that you would know the Lord’s joy as you pursue this goal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nBody\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Christlike Speech on Social Media Platforms', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Kshitiz Sharma Ghimire', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Communication 11', 'question': 'As believers, we should be truthful and sincere, gentle and graceful, in our speech, both in daily conversations and on social media.', 'body': 'When you are about to post on Facebook, it greets you with a question, “What’s on your mind?” Imagine if everything that was on our mind got posted on Facebook automatically. What if all the bitter, lustful, angry thoughts were automatically posted on Facebook? How many of us would still use social media? You, however, may breathe a sigh of relief knowing that you can curate your best thoughts or experiences for the world to see on social media. But Scripture tells us that even before there is a word on our tongue, God knows it all (Psalm 139:4). So, how do we as Christians use social media in the presence of our all-knowing and all-present God if nothing escapes His holy gaze?\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhether through news, Facebook posts, or tweets, we are reminded daily of the reality of the sinfulness of this world by how the truth is suppressed, distorted and abhorred (Romans 1:18). Many tend to distort the truth in their favor or use words to put down the other person. The goal is always to elevate themselves. The propensity to sin with our speech online could be due to a lack of immediate consequences because who is there to punish these “keyboard warriors”? As Christians, are we then living like functional atheists? Moreover, it would be naïve to think that our online speech will not translate to our real-life conversations. Thus, it calls for urgency among us believers, who have been transformed by the gospel to this new life of righteousness, to be truthful and sincere, gentle and graceful, in our speech, both in daily conversations and on social media.\\xa0\\nIn the ‘Sermon on the Mount’, while correcting the false teachers of His time who were flippantly and carelessly taking false oaths, Jesus encourages His believers by teaching, “Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil” (Matthew 5:37). While Jesus was not prohibiting or banning the taking of oaths, He was calling upon His believers to be truthful and sincere in everything they say. Ephesians 5:1 also commands us to imitate God, and the contrary is sobering, because when we sin, we are imitating the Father of lies. So, any speech other than what is truthful and sincere does not represent the character of our truthful God, but of Satan.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWays to Identify If Our Speech is Christlike or Not\\xa0\\nExamine your speech: You know better than anyone else (with the exception of God Himself), if you are being truthful or not in your speech. In fact, this might also be a motivation to stay silent rather than speak in an untruthful, insincere or rash manner (James 1:9). Moreover, Ephesians 4:29 can be a great motivator for us to examine our speech. Even when we are being truthful, is our speech motivated by love to build the other person? Does it fit the occasion or is it spoken at an appropriate time? And lastly, does it provide grace to the hearer? Imagine how many social media arguments would have been avoided if believers filtered their speech through the grid of Ephesians 4:29.\\xa0\\nHere are a few ways that we fail to be Christlike in our speech on social media:\\xa0\\nWe are quick to post a comment with little thought.\\xa0\\nWe give sarcastic, hurtful or degrading comments to shame or bring down the other person.\\xa0\\nWe make crude jokes or laugh at inappropriate humor.\\xa0\\nWe make social media posts with a self-glorifying intent.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe complain or brag about our earthly blessings with no thanksgiving to our Creator.\\xa0\\xa0\\nExamine your heart: Scripture tells us that our hearts are deceitful (Jeremiah 17:9), and it is through our thoughts, speech and behavior that we can see the remaining sin of our hearts. This is why Jesus says in Luke 6:45, “Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks” (emphasis mine). What is the state of our heart? Look at your speech. We could even be self-righteous when we see the open depravity on social media, and be quick to say, “At least that’s not me.” Paul, however, says that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God, and then proceeds to remind us of our condition before salvation: “And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God” (1 Corinthians 6:11, emphasis mine).\\xa0\\xa0\\nOn the other hand, we could be enjoying the sins that Christ died for when we think it’s harmless to laugh at crude jokes or sin against an image-bearer of God with our speech online. Here, we need to repent and ask God to give us a higher view of who He is and a proper view of our sin because sin is enjoyable in our flesh. This is why James tells us that we cannot tame the tongue on our own, it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. With our tongue, we bless our Lord and Father and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God (James 3:8-9). Thus, our sinful speech is more than just a lack of self-control, pride, and self-righteousness, it is because we cannot change our sinful nature. This is why the regeneration of the Holy Spirit is a supernatural work to create us into a new creation, and God has promised to change us from the inside out!\\xa0\\nSo, as we imitate Christ, we are to put off the evil practices of our old nature with the help of Holy Spirit, and we also need to put on the righteousness that reflects our new nature. How do we put on Christlikeness in our speech?\\xa0\\nSaturate your speech with God’s Word: One of the things that I have learned from my experience of counseling is that I am less prone to fail with my words and harm others with my speech when I am more dependent on using God’s word in my conversations. While our words are flawed and cannot be fully trusted, God’s word is trustworthy. This is where James 1:9 is helpful again; we are to be slow to speak but quick to listen. While we spend time in God’s Word, we are opening our ears to hear what God has to say, which will impact our speech to be glorifying to God. God’s Word warns us not to be quick to speak (James 1:9), not to speak corruptly, but to speak to build the other person up in grace (Ephesians 4:29), to speak the truth with love (Ephesians 4:15), and to encourage others gently towards righteousness (Galatians 6:1). Like Luke 6:45 suggests, when God’s Word goes in as good treasure in our heart, Christ-like speech comes out of our mouth.\\xa0\\nAs we remember that everything in our lives and conversation is in His presence, it challenges us to examine our speech. Similarly, recognizing that what comes out of our mouth may indeed be the thing which will determine what others will think of Him challenges us to strive for Christlike speech. May those around us see our Christlike speech and glorify our Father who is in heaven (Matthew 5:16).\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKshitiz Sharma Ghimire is ACBC certified and serves as Pastor of Student Ministries at Riverdale Baptist Church in Flint, MI.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

Two Christians, members of the same family (or of God’s family), are trying to resolve a conflict when one of them shuts down right in the middle of the process. “What’s going on here?” you wonder. You’re not sure where to begin probing. “Is he angry? Is she afraid? Is it a matter of vengeance—is she purposely shutting down in order to pay back the other for some hurtful comment that was made earlier in the conversation? Has he never been taught proper biblical communication skills? Is she trying to avoid conflict, or, is it simply a matter of her choosing to not answer because she doesn’t know what to say?”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo Speak or Not To Speak?\\xa0\\nRegardless of what’s behind it, in the final analysis, if the Christian doesn’t understand that he has a biblical responsibility to communicate in the midst of conflicts—if he is not convicted that in most circumstances it is unbiblical to refuse to communicate (even if it’s only to politely ask for a “rain check”)—then he will be slow to change.\\xa0\\n\\xa0“But isn’t it better to keep silent in many cases?” you may be wondering. “Besides, what about those verses in Scripture (like Proverbs 17: 27-28) that basically tell us it’s better to keep our mouths shut than to sin.”\\xa0\\nHe who restrains his words has knowledge,\\xa0And he who has a cool spirit is a man of understanding.Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is considered wise;\\xa0When he closes his lips, he is considered prudent.\\nSure, generally speaking, Christians are exhorted to be cool-spirited, calm, cheek-turning, peace makers who make every effort to maintain unity. And, on the other side of the same coin, we are exhorted to avoid being contentious, to keep away from strife, to not quarrel, or battle and a dozen other things that are usually thought of as conflict. But there are times when we must speak if we want to please God.\\xa0\\xa0\\nChristians, as a rule, are to be active rather than passive in the communication process. They may not sit passively by, expecting those with whom they are supposed to be conversing to take all of the initiative. But rather than volunteering the data necessary for the dialogue, inactive individuals expect their counterparts to drag out of them all but the most basic information.\\xa0\\nBiblical Communication Principles\\xa0\\nHere are a few biblical communication principles along with some corresponding Scripture reference from which the principles have been extrapolated. In doing so, it is my hope that by unpacking for your uncommunicative counselees, you may help them to reprogram their underdeveloped consciences and thereby help them find more freedom to communicate when and as they ought.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSometimes, to not speak is a sin (Ezekiel 33:8; Ecclesiastes 3:7b; Esther 4:13-14; Luke 17:3). Because love does not act unbecomingly (it is not rude), it does not impolitely become unresponsive but rather gives an appropriate answer. If it is not able to provide the requested information, it explains why it cannot—or at least that it cannot—currently respond as expected to the request1C.f.\\xa0Matthew 15:23–26, Mark 11:29–30\\xa0This is the rule. There are exceptions to the rule as, for example,\\xa0when Jesus refused to answer\\xa0questions\\xa0from certain individuals. (1 Corinthians 13:5a; 1 Corinthians 10:32; Colossians 4:6; Romans 12:10).\\xa0Love takes the initiative to express itself—even when it may “hurt” the person being loved (2 Corinthians 2:4, 7:8).\\xa0Withdrawing in the midst of a conflict (without good reason) is often a selfish decision (Proverbs 18:1; Galatians 2:11-14).Those in superior positions (parents, bosses, teachers, rulers) have a right and responsibility to request information from their subordinates. Those in subordinate positions have a responsibility to open up to (communicate with) their superiors (Proverbs 25:2; Ecclesiastes 8:4;).\\xa0It is sometimes proper to respond with a totally different answer than what might be expected (Proverbs 26:4-5).\\xa0Sometimes we must speak even when we are asked to keep quiet (Acts 4:18-20).\\xa0It is not necessarily wrong to communicate when one is angry (as long as the anger is righteous rather than sinful2I mention this because many\\xa0Christian’s\\xa0believe that if they are angry (even if righteously so) they must remain silent rather than speak. Consequently, out of fear of committing one sin (a sin of commission), they commit another (a sin of omission) by remaining silent when they should speak.\\xa0and is transmitted through biblical means of communication)3When righteous anger is expressed with sinful forms of communication it will likely be perceived as sinful anger. More importantly, will also be viewed as sin by God (Job 32:4-6; Mark 3:5; Acts 17:16-17).\\xa0\\nI have unpacked each of these principles a bit more in Resolving Conflict: How to make, Disturb and Keep Peace.\\xa0But until you have a chance to check that out, I trust what I have written here will be useful to you in your ministry of the Word.\\xa0\\n\\nHelpful Resources:\\nResolving Conflict: How to Make, Disturb, and Keep Peace by Lou Priolo\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLou Priolo is an ACBC Fellow and Director of Counseling at Christ Covenant Church in Atlanta, GA.

It says something about who we are. Are we saying things consistent with God’s character or are we not?', 'body': 'Dale Johnson: This week I am thrilled to have with us Dr. Jim Newheiser who is Professor of Biblical Counseling at Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. He’s also the Director of their Christian counseling programs there in Charlotte as well. He’s married to his wife Caroline. Jim is a long time ACBC certified member. He’s a fellow and he also serves on our board. I’m so grateful to be working on a consistent basis with Dr. Newheiser and for the wisdom that he brings and the way in which he is a wonderful sounding board to me on so many issues. I just really appreciate his wisdom. He really needs no introduction to our audience at ACBC. He’s been a teacher among us for quite some time. \\nJim, recently you did a breakout session at one of our Annual Conferences on this topic, wise speech from Proverbs, the beauty of words and the way in which God, by revelation, has given us words and language and communication and how we are to utilize those words. One of the things you talk about is the beauty of a theology of words. Help our listeners to understand what you mean by a theology of words.\\xa0\\nJim Newheiser: Many years ago, Paul Tripp wrote a book called War of Words and I was really impressed by the fact that he begins in terms of the fact that the Bible begins with God speaking. He speaks the world and everything in it into being. The next voice you hear is a really bad voice and that is the serpent who is denying God. He talks about how everything that is said after that, by anyone, including us, is either representing God’s speech or the serpent’s speech. It provides such a more rich view of speech than just the common grace wisdom so many people in the world may think about. I mean, everybody thinks, hey, gossip’s a bad idea. Lying isn’t good. We don’t want to hurt people with our speech, and not that we practice that, but there’s general agreement that those are good things. My talk is from Proverbs. Proverbs has all these statements of wisdom that, in some ways, sound similar to Egyptian or Babylonian wisdom, yet Proverbs begins in the fear of the Lord and covenant relationship with the Lord. So it’s not merely tricks to speak well, but it’s actually, in relationship to God, speaking His Word, His words to others. Then as you already said, God has revealed Himself to us in words and knowing Him would be impossible without those words.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: That’s a really interesting way to describe that and I love it because what you’re doing, instead of taking words that we sort of flippantly utilize or, you talked about the issue of Gossip, for example, we sort of look at that in 2D as something that’s been splattered across the page and we sort of give it value or yeah, we probably shouldn’t do that. It’s a moral impropriety. What you’re describing is that God’s revelation, our idea of words, it adds depth to it when we understand that this is placed within an understanding of who God is and how we speak. What we speak is revealing. It says something about us. Are we saying things consistent with God or are we not? Now this matters because words are a part of what we do in counseling, not just our words to the counselee but even the words that the counselee gives to us, and they tell us something about the counselee. So what are some of the things that you learn about the counselee when you hear them speak?\\xa0\\nJim Newheiser: Yes, like you said, counseling is words. We’re talking, we’re listening, and we’re using the Word of God. Jesus, in Luke 6, says it’s out of the heart that the mouth speaks. So, if you want to learn how to help the counselee, you have to listen. Often times, even when people try to put on masks and hide their real thoughts and intentions—there’s an expression I have. Especially like with an abuser, if you just let him keep talking, he will hang himself with his words. As people keep going, you often will find out why they did what they did or what they believe that is behind what they did wrong, their bad theology, their wrong view of God, their wrong view of what they expect from God, or how God treats them, or that God is not a loving father. So listening is so important. We often use Proverbs 18:13 that says it’s a folly and a shame to speak before you’ve heard. It’s especially true in counseling. Then, as you said, we also then use God’s Word to help people.\\nDale Johnson: And where there are many words, there’s much sinning, the Scripture says. We’ve got to be cautious about the way in which we speak, but it is helpful, as a counselor, when you’re asking questions and you hear people talk. You get a sense of how they’re seeing life, how they understand life in relation to God or not. You get a sense of how they’re interpreting what’s going on around them—maybe justification, why they’re doing the things that they’re doing. It’s revealing about them. Listen, I wish this weren’t true, but our words are often harmful. Sometimes the way that I speak, sometimes the way maybe that you speak, it can be harmful to people. The Scripture even warns us about the volatility of our tongue and the dangers of it. So Jim, I want you to talk for just a second about how it is that we as people harm each other with our words.\\xa0\\nJim Newheiser: A verse I love is James 1:19, which tells us we should be quick to listen and slow to speak and slow to anger. I even know for myself in recent days, I’ve had situations that were really difficult for me and I wanted to speak and tell people exactly where they were wrong. There might have been some accuracy to what I said, but there would have been transgression mixed. Just slowing down—and this is the thing I think where social media is especially insidious in that what I would say to someone I disagree with, if they were in the room and I’m looking at him, would be very different than sitting alone and typing on my phone screen the first thing that comes to my mind. So I think, you know, our hearts are revealed by our failed words and that’s why we need to be so guarded in our speech, because there will be things that come out of me that feel perfectly just or right that may not, as you say, speak the truth in love. Sometimes something may sound true and yet it’s not edifying. I may think this person is awful in a certain way, but that’s not necessarily going to build them up to throw it at them.\\xa0\\nDale Johson: You know, at the same time, what’s amazing to me is, yes, we speak and sometimes flippantly and we’re very harmful in the language that we speak, and sometimes that’s unintended, but it’s harmful nonetheless. I think that’s obvious based on us as being sinners. I think the more brilliant thing is, how is it that God allows us, by our words, to do something that is encouraging, to do something that’s edifying, to do something that builds another person up? What a stewardship. What a responsibility that God has given us. So what are some of the ways that we can think about building others up with our words?\\xa0\\nJim Newheiser: There are all kinds of categories in Proverbs in terms of sweet speech, encouragement, and affirmation, but I would go back to the fact that, because our words are flawed, the more we can use the actual Word of God with people—and that’s what we do in counseling. That’s why we’re biblical counselors. It’s very hard for me to construct a paragraph, a book, a sentence without there being something wrong with it. If I am focused on the Word of God, I’m reading it, my counselee is reading it—these are perfect words. \\nIt’s been sad to me, sometimes, seeing even people who would call themselves biblical counselors saying, well, you don’t want to get out your Bible too fast. You don’t want to push the Bible on people too much. Well, what better do you have to say than that? We need to listen, but our goal is to deliver the perfect words of the Bible, which give encouragement and admonishment and hope and comfort. The best possible words to help in every possible situation are found in the Scriptures. You have, the law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul. The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. Then on you go. So that’s our privilege. That’s why we want to be biblical counselors, because even common grace wisdom that may not be awful is nothing compared to the perfect wisdom of the Word of God, which is life-transforming. So the best way we can build people up is to not even just say Scriptural things, which is good, but what is best is to bring the Word of God to people.\\nDale Johnson: What wise words, Jim. I hope that we can take those things to heart. We have a stewardship. We can tear down, as the Bible says, or we can build up and that really is the intention. Now, I want to go back to something that I think you gave some wise context for, and even really in terms of warning. You talked about social media. It has changed the way that we think. I mean, it has changed the way that we talk. It changes the way that we address one another. Talk a little bit about how, in the world, social media really impacts our speech in the way that we talk.\\nJim Newheiser: One thing that I think about, even in terms of social media, is where there’s a Proverb that talks about how the words of a gossiper are like dainty morsels. Sometimes I think we can be attracted to social media or following people who will give us these dainty morsels that may actually cause bad indigestion or worse. We can be influenced. There’s language in the Proverbs about how if you’re with someone with angry speech, you may be tempted to imitate them. So it’s not just what we say, but to whom we listen. Sometimes, because of our sinfulness, we like especially when people who are in our tribe are shooting arrows at some other tribe we don’t like as much, even if they do so in an unkind way or twist the truth. As long as they’re landing blows for our side, we can read that, like it—whatever way you do it in your social media. Then, back to the slow to speech part, there’s so many things that just aren’t my calling to address on social media. I mean, I’m old enough where, before social media, even on email I would find that somebody would send you an e-mail you didn’t like and in five minutes I can tell him exactly why he was wrong and what I think of him. I should never do that. Do not press send. That’s the slow to speech part. We have to be just careful with our speech, using Ephesians 4:29 as a filter. Let nothing unwholesome come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building up, appropriate for the need of the moment, that it may give grace to those who hear. That filter would reduce the number of our words, as well as the content would be changed.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: What’s important about this, I think, is that this changes the value of our words, right? Now the way in which we speak, it raises the stakes in what we’re doing. I mean, even what you talked about on social media, much of that is speaking for ourselves. We’re speaking to defend ourselves, promote ourselves, build our self up, but the kind of words that you’re talking about—the beautiful theology of words when we think biblically and wisely from the Proverbs about speech—now this is a stewardship. It’s a way in which we raise the value of the words that come out of our mouth in a way that’s consistent with what God intended, which is to edify, to grow, to build others up. That speech that’s selfless, that speech that’s focused on the good of another, it radically transforms the way that we talk and the value of it. Now, we want to talk about that transition because the gospel—as much as we struggle and words are difficult and sometimes we use words harmfully to defend ourselves—the gospel changes not just a little piece of us. It changes everything about us. Praise be to God that the gospel changes us in such a way that it enables us to change the way that we talk. So I want you to give some expression to that. What are we talking about there? How does the gospel change or enable us to speak better?\\xa0\\nJim Newheiser: Well, as you know, the Scripture says that when we become believers, we become a new creation. So we who were speaking on behalf of the evil one all the time are now given the ability to speak in an edifying way in the image of God. When I was studying James years ago, in chapter 3, he’s bemoaning how the tongue destroys and he talks about how we’ve tamed all these animals, but we can’t tame the tongue. It’s interesting, there’s a fairly obscure Greek word that’s not used that often, but it comes up in one of Jesus miracles when you had an untamable demoniac and shackles and everything else couldn’t hold him. That’s an illustration of our tongues where, I mean, we say, I can’t believe I said that. I can’t stop myself. For some people, lying is their native language. Well what can happen? Well at the end of the passage, when this man encountered Jesus, the untamable man became a man who was in his right mind, which also terrified the people more than his craziness did. But it’s an encounter with Jesus which can take us from being out of control in our speech to enable us to be in our right mind, to go from speaking for our own kingdom, or the kingdom of this world, and to speak for the kingdom of God. It’s only His transforming power that can do that. So I think the dilemma that James bemoans is really solved as we’re united with Him, given a new birth, as James talks about in Chapter 1, and given a new nature, which enables us beautifully to fulfill the purpose for which God created us, which is to glorify Him with our speech.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I don’t know about you as a listener, but when I hear what Dr. Newheiser is describing, it’s a wave of just comfort and hope that God has given us through the gospel to change what we know often is so difficult about ourselves, and he’s giving us a new person, a new heart. He’s made us a new creation where we can think and speak differently for the good of others. \\nNow, I want to definitely talk about this topic, but you’ve got another resource that has contributed in this particular area of wise words or wise speech. In fact, this lady needs no introduction to our crowd at ACBC. Miss Caroline Newheiser, your wife, has recently written a book, I think co-authored a book, called When Words Matter Most and she talks about this subject I think quite a bit. So introduce us to that book, Jim.\\xa0\\nJim Newheiser: First of all, the wisest person I’ve ever known with speech is my wife. She humbles me with how gracious, affirming, and yet now she’s also learned to admonish me. She’s the best Galatians 6:1 person I’ve ever known for gently encouraging me when I’m wrong. She and our dear friend Cheryl Marshall wrote together this book. It’s mainly for women, but men can profit as well by just applying principles of Scripture to help others with their words, even in terms for those who are fearful or worried or suffering or falling into sin. It has been said for many years in our movement, everybody’s a counselor, it’s just whether you’re any good or not. It’s encouraging women, especially, to use their words biblically to build each other up as they have Titus 2 kinds of conversations with one another. \\nSo yes, thank you. They’ve done a great job and I’m very proud of her, and I think it will help many to use their words well.\\n\\nHelpful Resources:\\nWar of Words by Paul Tripp\\nWhen Words Matter Most by Caroline Newheiser and Cheryl Marshall\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

These beautiful words demonstrate the goal of the biblical counselor’s conversation with the counselee. In biblical times oil and perfume were luxurious gifts from a gracious host. When a guest arrived for a feast, sweet smells and soothing oil felt welcoming and brought refreshment. We desire our counselees to know they are welcomed when they arrive and refreshed by our words when they leave. The biblical words we share are as desirable as honey in a desert land (Psalm 19:10, Psalm 119:103).\\xa0\\nThis blog is the second in a series about the qualities a good counselor should possess. The first article discussed the counselor’s\\xa0character: Spirit-filled, humble, and caring.\\xa0This blog is about the words\\xa0used by an effective counselor.\\xa0Her words\\xa0should be self-controlled, wise, and filled with hope.1For more information, see\\xa0When Words Matter Most: Speaking Truth\\xa0with Grace to Those You Love\\xa0by Cheryl Marshall and Caroline Newheiser.\\xa0\\nA Gracious Counselor is Self-Controlled.\\xa0\\nAnyone who has counseled for a while has learned that impulsive speech is generally not helpful. It’s easy to blurt out reactions to a problem without knowing all the pertinent aspects and details (Proverbs 18:13,17). It’s easy to cut off someone’s story because you have heard it before. It’s easy to give simplistic solutions which may not apply. Instead, remember Proverbs 25:28, “A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls.” The best biblical counselor will guard her mouth (Proverbs 13:3). Then you will avoid the subsequent confession which must come after you realize that your words came out too quickly because you didn’t listen well. Ask the Lord for cautious and considered words.\\xa0Pray for a heart filled with self-control, knowing that your words reflect what’s in your heart (Luke 6:45). Then you will have the time to patiently consider how the Word can be used to help the counselee.\\xa0\\xa0\\nA Gracious Counselor is Wise.\\xa0\\nCounselors may give their opinions and share solutions, but only those words backed by Scripture will be wise. “For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding” (Proverbs 2:6). We don’t want to rely on common sense or our experience of what “works”. The Bible warns us against leaning on our own understanding and being wise in our own eyes (Proverbs 3:5, 8). I picture leaning against something flimsy which won’t support a person’s weight. That person will fall. Knowing and doing God’s Word is as solid as a rock (Matthew 6:24-27). Wisdom begins with knowing God and His ways. A study of Proverbs chapter two inspires the Christian to seek God’s Word for wisdom. When the wise counselor earnestly seeks the Lord, her words will be filled with wisdom. Pray for a heart filled with wisdom, knowing that your words come from your heart (Matthew 12:34b).\\xa0\\nA Gracious Counselor is Hopeful.\\xa0\\nChristians, of all people, should be filled with hope.\\xa0Our solid\\xa0foundation built on God’s Word gives confidence in God and in His promises. This hope is contagious as it spreads from you to the troubled person sitting in front of you (Proverbs 10:28). A small dose of hope can multiply because it is based on truth. The world around us says, “Hopefully things will turn out all right.” Christians say, “I know that God is working all things for your good and His glory, because I believe what God says in Romans 8:28.” That verse begins, “We\\xa0know…” This knowledge is based on God himself and His trustworthy promise to conform us to Christ. He who began changing us will continue to change us. “I am\\xa0sure\\xa0of this…” (Philippians 1:6). This hope is powerful but should be applied carefully. Your counselee may need some time to grieve and lament before hearing God’s uplifting words. You can ask, “Would it be all right if I share the reason for the hope that is within me?” If she agrees, express your confidence with gentleness and respect (1 Peter 3:15). Pray for a heart filled with hope, knowing that “the heart of a man reflects the man” (Proverbs 27:19).\\xa0\\nThe Christian counselor recognizes that her words have power. The conversations she has with others can be meaningful and\\xa0life-changing. They can have eternal consequences. They can be used to direct others to a path which is life-giving and God-honoring. Let us pray for our words to be self-controlled,\\xa0wise, and full of hope, that they may bless those who hear\\xa0(Luke 11:28, Revelation 1:3).\\xa0\\n\\nHelpful Resources\\nA Counselor’s Character Matters\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline Newheiser is the Assistant Coordinator of Women’s Counseling at Reformed Theological Seminary – Charlotte.

It is to be coupled with teaching.', 'body': 'Dale Johnson:\\xa0This week on the podcast, I want to address this issue of admonition. This is obviously a very critical word in the Scripture, particularly as it relates to the way we think about counsel or counseling and the way we think about discipleship even, it’s a very important word, but it’s interesting to me how we in biblical counseling—particularly those who wear the ACBC stripe—are often stereotyped or even labeled that admonition is really the only work that we do. Admonition really is an art, but it’s a biblical idea; it’s not something we should shy away from. Here’s the thing that I want us to be cautioned about, and I’m going to talk about this broadly at the beginning and then I want to bring that into the counseling room as we think about admonition and the importance of it.\\xa0\\nJude 1:3 tells us to contend for the faith, and I think that’s an important piece. As I look around social media and different places, people giving critiques. It’s often really interesting at how quickly critiques are dismissed of different philosophies or different ideas and we do a fair amount of critique even on the podcast or from ACBC. We think it’s a part of our job to make sure that we’re contending for the faith and that contending for the faith takes a couple of different forms much like it would in the counseling room for many of you. You’re contending for the faith in relation to this individual and part of what you’re trying to do is you’re trying to help them to think rightly about the things that they are engaged in. You are helping them to think biblically and sometimes what that means is you’re correcting their unbiblical ideas. \\nThat’s the same idea when we try to look at secular theories. We’re not trying to attack those theories. We’re not trying to, you know, demean the people who try to employ them, I think the goal for us is we just simply want to make people aware of the ideologies that are behind those philosophies and that’s a part of our admonition. Now, I do want to make very clear, there are folks who write critiques in a very uncharitable way and very haughty and prideful way. That’s not what I’m talking about. That’s not a biblical view of admonition. I think admonition is speaking the truth in love. We have the responsibility to speak the truth in a spirit of gentleness and kindness and love. What I think has happened is we’ve sort of moved in the direction of what I call charitable takes, and we’ve moved in the direction of where we simply just want to say everything that’s positive about something without ever mentioning anything negative. I think that’s harmful to some degree. Let me flesh that out if I can, I think what that leads to can be very dangerous. We want to see the positive in certain things. That’s absolutely true. But we also want to make sure that we’re making folks aware of the problems within a system or the problems within a philosophy or the problems within a counseling methodology as it relates to us, particularly here in biblical counseling.\\xa0\\nI want to mention that this idea of admonition is to be coupled with teaching. So teaching is this aspect of building up. We want to give a building up and edification of the truth of Scripture. We want to build a biblical view in all things, but we also have to couple that teaching with admonition, the correction of false ideas because those detract from the pure teaching of the Word. So, what we have to do is exactly what Paul tries to do in somewhere like Colossians 1, where he couples together this phrase teaching and admonishing consistently through that book starting in Colossians 1:28, where he says, it’s Him we proclaim (talking about Christ), admonishing every man and teaching every man, for what purpose? So that they can become complete in Christ. The idea is the way forward to help someone to become complete in Christ takes both teaching, a building up, where there’s ignorance in a person’s understanding of who God is and how they’re to respond to Him and how they walk faithful as a disciple, they teach, but then there’s also this aspect of admonishing and what are they called to do? We are called to disciple them in such a way that we admonish them. We don’t think that they’re a blank slate\\xa0coming to us, they come as an unbeliever or an immature believer, and we have things that need to be corrected in their heart. As we teach, I don’t want them to just add my ideas of teaching from the Scripture on to their already massive mound of philosophies and the way they approach life. It has to be as we teach in biblical counseling, a put off and put on.\\nNow, before we get too far down that road, I want to talk about admonishing. Admonishing is not something that’s exclusive. It is to be coupled with teaching. Both of those aspects are our reality. I don’t think Dr. Jay Adams, when he coined the idea of nouthetic or noutheteo counseling, I don’t think he was trying to say we are exclusively admonishing, right? He’s saying\\xa0that in the biblical context we are to admonish, but we’re not to do that exclusively, as Paul talks about it in Colossians 1 and so on in the book that we are not to be exclusive in this aspect, but we are to both teach and admonish. I think the danger, some people’s reaction or reflex has been to do less admonition and only teaching, but I think that leads to a lot of problems as well.\\xa0\\nWhen we critique, one of the things we want to make sure that we do that’s a part of the art of admonishing, I think, is to always accurately represent those whom you’re critiquing or the ideas that you’re critiquing. Or if you’re in the counseling room, for example, if you are admonishing a person, you want to make sure that you understand how they’re seeing something from their perspective, and then you speak confidently the truth, lay the truth of God upon their mind in order to admonish them. I think this is important because the Bible itself is actually presented in much the same way in sort of a thesis-antithesis perspective. \\nOne of the places that we see that, that I think for us, we in biblical counseling, we get our methodology from the Scriptures, obviously the put off and put on passage, but another place that’s very critical is in Psalm 1. Remember the psalmist begins the whole of the book by saying blessed is the man, and you think at that moment, “Okay we’re getting a definition, we’re getting a definition of what it means to be someone who pursues happiness or someone who finds himself walking in a blessed way.” And then he goes straight to the negative. Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers but his delight is in the law of the Lord. Do you see it? The thesis and the antithesis sort of wrapped into one. How do we pursue blessing? Well, it takes us, yes, building up and encouraging and teaching but then also admonishing, right? We don’t want someone to couple the idea of I’m going to pursue delight in the law of the Lord, but I am also going to walk in the way of sinners. I’m going to stand in the way of sinners or I’m going to sit under the counsel of the wicked. Those two things are against one another, and one will fall at some point. Those two things cannot be complementary to one another. They’re actually walking in different directions. \\nWhen we think about admonition, that’s a part of what we’re doing. We see biblical truth, and our goal is to give affirmation and a denial. We want to be expressive in how we think about admonishing. We want to make sure that we’re covering both sides, what to pursue and what to take off. I mean, anyone who’s done training in biblical counseling you understand the idea of put off and put on. This is the basic premise of how humans change from the Scriptures is we are called to put off. Well, what does that mean? Admonition has to take place, which is: We don’t think like this, we don’t behave like this, this is not what it means to follow Christ, so we are putting this part off, this unbiblical thinking, we’re taking these thoughts captive, and so on. We’re going to crucify the flesh in this way. That’s the antithesis where we’re removing that, we are admonishing, if you will, to say this needs to come off. Then the teaching aspect: We want you to put this on from the Scriptures, and so you can see this back-and-forth of admonition, it’s always coupled. It’s as if teaching and edification and building up is the other side of the coin when we admonish, and we shouldn’t be admonishing without also offering, teaching a solution, if you will.\\xa0\\nI think that’s a critical point when we think about admonition. You’re not just wanting to confront someone with truth without giving them some path forward from the Scripture, that’s a healthy way to live from that perspective. Now, why do I bring this up? Why is this such an important question? I want us to ask this question. What are the dangers if we neglect to admonish? I think one of the reasons that I am concerned about this is I get questions quite frequently about “Why do we talk negatively sometimes about secular theories? Or why do we even raise some of those issues?” Well, I think it’s important to have that conversation. I think there are dangers if we neglect to admonish. If all we’re doing is building up a biblical view, which I think is 100 percent appropriate, and we need to do better at that, so I fully agree we need to do better at building a biblical view of how to approach counseling, how to approach issues. The more issues that we see in our in our human experiences that we need to be biblicists,\\xa0running back to the Scriptures to see: What does the Scripture say? Let’s build a methodology from the Scriptures. In no way am I denying that we need to do that—absolutely!\\xa0\\nBut also see this danger if we lack to admonish in the same way, that if all we do is admonish, if we think biblical counseling is only admonishing, it’s a danger. But in the same way if all we do is the teaching or the building up, lacking admonition, I think there’s a danger there as well. I think we have to do both of these things faithfully. I want you to think, one danger that I see is sort of exemplified in Simon the Magician in the Scriptures where by all accounts of what Acts 8 says that Simon trusted Christ, but by the same token, it seems as though he was begging the apostles wanting some of the power that they had and had the apostles not admonished him, called him even to repentance by his desire to pursue this just because of what it would give to him. I think we run the risk if we’re not willing to stand up against ideas or thoughts that would lead a person astray or lead to the building up of themselves. Then I don’t think we fall prey to encouraging that movement like Simon the Magician.\\xa0\\nI think it also leads to a syncretism. What do you mean by that? Well, I’ve talked about it on the podcast in the past in terms of eclecticism, a syncretism where people are introduced to the ways of biblical counseling and they hear, and they think, “Wow yeah, this is a really good way to think about the Bible, but I also want to incorporate bits and pieces,” thinking that all these other secular theories are quite complementary and with little filter or with little discernment they began to imbibe all of these secular theories and sort of adding it to the toolbox of the Bible. The problem is that the Scriptures get crowded out and the loser is the Scripture as we begin to imbibe these secular theories that we once thought were complementary to the Scripture, we begin to look to those theories more than we look to the Bible. We begin to promote the ideas and the methodologies of those secular theories over and against the Bible or we allow those theories to sort of now rearrange a proper hermeneutic or interpretation of the Scriptures. We run the danger of syncretism or eclecticism, where we think the Bible is one among many toolboxes. Well, that’s not a biblical view. That’s not a proper theological view of the Scripture as being authority in our life, and that the Bible gives us the Words of life, I think it builds an improper disposition. So, our job is consistently to, yes, build biblical methodology, and I think in the movement we have to do that better. I pray that you as counselors are doing that on a consistent basis, searching the Scripture constantly to build up what the Bible says about how to engage certain types of counseling issues but by the same token as you build up, you’re having to say no to other ideas in your mind. That’s a part of building truth and how you see truth come to life is, as you see truth transform you from the inside out, you begin to see what’s not a part of that truth and that’s the antithesis where we say no to those things.\\xa0\\nNow, what does this mean for the counseling room? I want us to think about in two ways. The first way we’ve talked about it just as thinking through secular theories, secular ideas. I think there’s a proper way for us to admonish, to contend for the faith, to protect people in the ways that they think broadly about secular ideas and things that may impact the way that we walk as believers or the way that we practice counseling in the counseling room. But there’s also something I think important as it relates to the counseling room. I see this sort of thing quite frequently, particularly when I’m supervising as a Fellow and when I’m supervising those who are working through certification. I do see a timidity to correct. I see a timidity in people, they naturally don’t want to engage in admonition, and that doesn’t mean yelling and screaming at people or anything like that. But there’s a timidity to want to even gently correct someone. They just want to do the teaching aspect, they want to turn counseling into just like a Bible lesson. That’s good, give them truth, we want to do that, but if you don’t help that person in the counseling room to process that this is biblical, and because this is biblical all these ideas that you’ve been thinking or the patterns that you’ve been following or the behaviors that you’ve been pursuing, they are unbiblical. You see the biblical truth here, this is over and against that, and that’s really important, and so I try to help my supervisees think through this issue well, to make sure that they’re guarding themselves, first of all, to know the Scripture well. Second, to know the person well, to know the patterns of thinking that they have, and then in a spirit of gentleness, as Galatians 6:1 describes, being able to confront them with the Scriptures. Speaking the truth in love, helping that person to see that what God says about their life is more important and gives better explanation than what the world is saying or the things that they’ve adopted in the way that they’re living right now.\\xa0\\nI think there’s also a fear of pushing someone away that if we admonish or if we correct in any way that we’re going to push that person away. By my experience, one of the things that I’ve seen is if I’m able to do this in a gentle and kind and a gracious way, to speak the truth and love to someone and when the light bulb goes on in their heart and in their mind, you have a friend for life because faithful are the wounds of a friend. And when they begin to see that the things that you’re describing are truth, and they begin to pursue that truth, you’ve helped them. You’ve guided them. You’ve guarded their soul, you’ve protected them, and they love you for it. They appreciate your willingness to engage them at that level. It is a slow process. You’re not swinging a sledgehammer at someone. It’s a slow process where you have a chisel and a hammer, and you’re just gently guiding, helping to sculpt the way that they see these things in their mind, and that’s our responsibility, so we can never neglect our responsibility to admonish. Is it a perfect science? Absolutely not. Do we always know exactly how to do this perfectly? Absolutely not. Do we sometimes fail in the way that we accomplished it? Yes. It is an art, learning to be able to admonish, but if we neglect it, I think we bring harm to our counselees, and I think we bring harm to our counselors in ACBC if we don’t do well at guarding people against those ideas that are not complementary to Scripture but are contradictory.\\xa0\\nMay our work be both coupled together with teaching, the building up of biblical ideas and methodology, and admonition. Those two things go together in Scripture, and I pray that they go together in our work as biblical counselors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

But he said that if he did so, it would need to be a much longer book. This is because Sam realizes that correcting people can be complicated. Jesus likens correcting people to taking a splinter or a speck out of someone’s eye—a delicate procedure to say the least (Matthew 7:5). Giving and receiving correction is always a sensitive subject. None of us enjoys having someone poke around in our eye. When the Apostle Paul tells us about our duty to restore one another he also emphasizes the importance of how we go about correcting one another. “Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted” (Galatians 6:1). Paul reminds us that the purpose of correction is restoration, or repair, of a brother or sister. We come, not to vent, but to help as we bear our brother’s burdens (Galatians 6:2). Paul reminds us that those who correct must be “spiritual”—that is they should be walking in the Spirit (Galatians 5:16ff). Most correction takes place in a fleshly hurtful way because many people avoid confrontation until they are so angry that they blow up with an “outburst of anger” (Galatians 5:20). This often leads to a defensive response or even a counter-attack from the person being admonished. To confront spiritually means that we are characterized by love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).\\xa0\\xa0\\nI believe that the best way to gently and lovingly offer correction is to do it as personally as possible—ideally face-to-face, or at least in a context in which immediate two-way communication is possible—such as a phone conversation or video conferencing (Facetime, Skype, Zoom, etc.). Jesus taught that if your brother sins against you that you should “go” and tell him his fault (Matthew 18:15). I have seen much harm take place when impersonal correction has taken place (i.e., texts and emails).\\nSome of us prefer to write to the person who needs correction because it seems easier. We may not be confident in our ability to think on our feet in a conversation. Writing down our thoughts may help us to clearly express our concerns. Because conflict is hard it may seem safer to send an email or a letter as opposed to having to confront a brother or sister directly.\\nI am still convinced, however, that there are significant disadvantages to admonishing people in writing and there are huge advantages to personal confrontation (as hard as that may seem).\\xa0\\nWe might say harsh, careless things in writing (especially if we are worked up/angry) that we would not say to a person’s face.Meeting personally enables a greater depth of communication. Love, concern, and warmth can be expressed through tone of voice and facial expressions. The one who is offering correction can see how their words are impacting their brother or sister and can respond compassionately.\\xa0Meeting personally gives opportunity for immediate clarification of possible misunderstandings. Written words can easily be misinterpreted.\\xa0You can’t tell tone of voice in a text or email.\\xa0 Someone might be trying to add a touch of humor in a serious text, but if it’s read in the wrong tone of voice, it can have the opposite of the intended effect.\\xa0 Someone might be writing to you with what is in their head a very calm tone of voice, but if you’re already a bit defensive, you can read it hearing their angry voice in your head and take it the wrong way. Tone of voice can make all the difference; it’s best to hear their actual voice.If you believe that it is necessary to put your thoughts in writing, then present what you have written at the same time that you speak about your concerns. Or you could use what you have written down as notes when you are talking to your brother or sister. You may find, however, that you will soften what you have written when you are actually facing your brother or sister.If you are going to perform eye surgery (correction), do it correctly. Some may object that it is often inconvenient to arrange a personal meeting. My answer would be that if there is an issue which is important enough to correct, then it is important enough to do it the best possible way—lovingly and face-to-face. Instead of thinking about what is easier for you, think of what would be the kindest and gentlest way to approach and restore your brother or sister.\\nMany years ago I heard about a group of elders who made an agreement that if any of them had a significant concern or correction of another that it would never be done in an email or a text, but that it would always take place in person. I think that this is a wise approach not only for church leaders, but also for families and friends.\\nI became aware of a situation in which two Christian friends were conducting a disagreement through an email exchange. The emails typically consisted of a defense of one’s own position and a challenge (or attack) of the views of the other. With each iteration relationships were deteriorating. Finally, a personal meeting was arranged. In an hour, as they met face-to-face they were able to reaffirm and restore their friendship. They also were able to engage in a profitable dialog in which they were able to better understand, respect, and appreciate each other’s positions.I was convinced that they achieved more in this hour than could have been achieved in dozens of emails.\\nFinally, I want to address how we should respond when others correct us. When someone is coming to correct me, I recite Proverbs 9:8 to myself. “Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you, reprove a wise man, and he will love you.” When we are being corrected we will often be tempted to defend ourselves and to counter-attack the person who is rebuking us. It is easy to focus upon how they don’t measure up to the standard they are setting for us, or how their manner of confronting us falls short of the biblical standard. Instead we should listen for what God may be telling us through this person.\\nSo, if you think someone needs correction, consider talking to them personally rather than writing.1This blog addresses conflicts which are of a private nature. There are situations in which someone has acted or written publicly to which a written and/or public response may be appropriate. Even then, I believe that it is wise to consider first going to the person privately to offer correction and to seek clarification before going public.\\xa0 Then, when you do respond to do so in a way which charitably seeks to assume the best, for “love hopes all things” (1 Corinthians 13:7).\\xa0On the other hand, I pray that God will help those of us being corrected to respond humbly (regardless of the approach), appreciating that it must be hard for a person to approach us with correction. Each of us is a sinner who needs correction. We should be thankful to have friends that love us enough to help. “Faithful are the wounds of a friend” (Proverbs 27:6).\\n\\nThis blog was originally posted at IBCD,\\xa0view the original post here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJim Newheiser is the Director of the Christian Counseling Program and Associate Professor of Christian Counseling and Practical Theology at RTS Charlotte.

      "{'title': 'Cómo hablar la verdad en amor', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Susan Heck', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Communication 11', 'question': 'Cuando aconsejo a alguien que diga la verdad en amor, ¿qué es exactamente lo que le estoy pidiendo que haga?', 'body': 'Como consejero bíblico, hay una frase que he utilizado a menudo con los que aconsejo. La frase es: “Di la verdad en amor”. Puede ser la respuesta que doy a una esposa que no sabe cómo confrontar a su marido o a su hijo; a un miembro de la iglesia que no sabe cómo confrontar a un compañero de iglesia; a un empleado que no sabe cómo hablar con su jefe; a un miembro de la familia que no sabe cómo decir la verdad a otro miembro de la familia; o a un cliente que está tratando con un negocio que está demostrando falta de integridad.\\xa0\\xa0\\nDebemos admitir que hablar la verdad en amor en un mundo de posverdad es a veces difícil, incluso como hijo de Dios. A menudo se nos considera arcaicos, sentenciosos. Con demasiada frecuencia, nos encontramos diciendo mentiras en lugar de la verdad, apelando a las emociones de la gente en lugar de su intelecto, y siendo amigos del mundo en lugar de amigos de Cristo.\\n¿Qué es hablar la verdad en amor?\\xa0\\nCuando aconsejo a alguien que hable la verdad en amor, ¿qué es exactamente lo que le estoy pidiendo que haga? La frase “hablar la verdad en amor” proviene de Efesios 4:15. Para entender el contexto de ese versículo, por favor lea Efesios 4:11-16.\\xa0\\nHablar la verdad en amor es hablar lo que es doctrinalmente correcto y lo que procede de una vida bíblicamente comprometida a una persona que necesita corrección. Se hace en amor para el beneficio de alguien que necesita algún ajuste en sus actitudes o sus acciones.\\n¿Por qué debemos decir la verdad en amor?\\nTal vez esté pensando: “Ya tengo suficientes problemas en mi propia vida y ciertamente no necesito estar creando más de ellos”. Debemos recordar que no se trata de nosotros, sino del bienestar espiritual de los demás. También lo hacemos porque es un mandato, como se ve en Efesios 4, Mateo 18:15-17 y Santiago 5:19-20.\\xa0\\nDe estos pasajes, diríamos que tenemos la responsabilidad de hablar la verdad en amor no sólo porque es un mandamiento, sino también por la pureza de la iglesia. Cuando no confrontamos a un hermano pecador, debilitamos la determinación de toda la iglesia.\\xa0\\nAdemás, salvar a un alma de la muerte, ayudándole a apartarse del error de su camino, es una razón digna para hacerlo. También cubrimos una multitud de pecados, lo que significa que el pecado se detiene en lugar de que continúe y sea expuesto ante los demás.\\n¿Por qué no decimos la verdad en amor?\\nLa primera razón por la que no hablamos la verdad en amor es el miedo al hombre. Tenemos miedo de perder amistades o de tensar las relaciones. Desafortunadamente, esto sólo agrava nuestro propio pecado. En Gálatas 1:10, Pablo nos advierte que si somos complacientes con el hombre, no somos siervos de Cristo.\\nOtra razón por la que no hablamos con los demás cuando es necesario es por el miedo al rechazo. Es posible que nos tachen de criticones o santurrones. Cuando esto sucede, podemos tener un gran consuelo en 1 Pedro 2:21-24.\\nOtra razón por la que no hablamos la verdad en amor es porque tememos no saber qué decir. Aunque esta preocupación es legítima, se puede remediar fácilmente estando preparados. Pablo es claro en Romanos 15:14 que todos los creyentes son capaces de ayudarse mutuamente, y en 2 Timoteo 2:15 Pablo nos dice cómo estar preparados para esta tarea. Somos competentes para aconsejar, pero debemos conocer lo que dice la Palabra de Dios para saber cómo abordar cada situación.\\n¿Dónde hablamos la verdad en amor?\\nDebemos decir la verdad en amor a nuestro propio corazón. Proverbios 27:19 dice: “Como en el agua se refleja el rostro, así el corazón del hombre revela al hombre”. ¿Cómo podemos ayudar a otra persona si no somos honestos con nosotros mismos primero? ¿Vemos con claridad o estamos nublados por la amargura o el resentimiento? (Véase Mateo 7:1-5).\\nDebemos hablar la verdad en amor en nuestros hogares, lo cual no significa que tenga que decir lo que pienso sobre cada tema que surja en un día determinado. Pero sí significa que si un niño o un cónyuge o cualquier otra persona que vive en el hogar tiene un patrón continuo de actitudes o acciones equivocadas, entonces debo abordarlo.\\xa0\\nDebemos hablar la verdad en amor en nuestras casas de adoración, lo cual incluye a cualquier persona que pertenezca a Cristo. Ya hemos citado Mateo 18, así que basta con decir que cuando hay una ofensa, tenemos la responsabilidad de ir a esa persona, y luego asegurarnos de seguir los pasos si no hay arrepentimiento.\\nDebemos decir la verdad en amor en nuestro mundo hostil. Por favor, sepa que la práctica de esto sin duda incurrirá en la persecución y el odio. Jesús nos ha advertido de ello en Juan 15:18-25.\\n¿Cómo decimos la verdad en amor?\\nDebemos orar antes, durante y después de nuestra conversación con ellos. Ore para que Dios abra su corazón para escuchar la verdad, ore mientras hable para que sus palabras no caigan en oídos sordos o en un corazón duro, y ore después para que el querido Espíritu Santo haga la obra de convicción de pecado y los lleve al arrepentimiento.\\xa0\\nJunto con la oración está la paciencia, como dice Pablo en 1 Tesalonicenses 5:14.\\n¿Cuál es el resultado de decir la verdad con amor?\\nPablo nos da varios resultados en 2 Timoteo 2:25-26. El primer fruto mencionado es el arrepentimiento, que es un alejamiento del pecado. Pablo menciona que otro resultado es que la persona a la que le hablamos puede entrar en razón.

      "{'title': 'How to Speak the Truth in Love', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Susan Heck', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Communication 11', 'question': 'When\\xa0I counsel someone\\xa0to speak the truth in love, what exactly am I calling them to do?', 'body': 'As a biblical counselor, there is a phrase I have often used with those I counsel.\\xa0The phrase is: “Speak the truth in love.” It might be the answer I give to a wife who doesn’t know how to confront her husband or her child; to a church member who doesn’t know how to confront a\\xa0fellow church member; to an employee who doesn’t know how to speak to\\xa0a boss; to a family member who doesn’t know how to speak truth to another\\xa0family member; or to a customer who is dealing with a business that is demonstrating a lack of integrity.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe must admit that\\xa0speaking the truth in love\\xa0in a post-truth world is at times difficult,\\xa0even as a child of God. We are often thought of as archaic, judgmental, profiling, and not relevant to society. Too often, we find ourselves speaking lies instead of truth, appealing to people’s emotions rather than their intellect, and being friends of the world rather than friends of Christ.\\xa0\\nWhat is Speaking the Truth in Love?\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen\\xa0I counsel someone\\xa0to speak the truth in love, what exactly am I calling them to do? The phrase “speak the truth in love” comes from Ephesians 4:15. To understand that verse’s context,\\xa0please read\\xa0Ephesians 4:11-16.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking the truth\\xa0in love\\xa0is speaking\\xa0that which is\\xa0doctrinally\\xa0correct and that\\xa0which proceeds from a biblically\\xa0committed life to a person who is in need of correction. It is done in love for the benefit of one who needs some adjustment to their attitudes or their actions.\\xa0\\nWhy Must We Speak the Truth in Love?\\xa0\\nPerhaps you’re thinking, “I have enough problems in my own life and I certainly don’t need to be creating more of them.”\\xa0We must remember, this is not about us; it is about the spiritual welfare\\xa0of others.\\xa0We also do this is because it is a command, as seen in\\xa0Ephesians 4,\\xa0Matthew 18:15-17,\\xa0and\\xa0James 5:19-20.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFrom these passages, we would say that we have a responsibility to speak the truth in love not only because it is a command,\\xa0but also for the purity of the church.\\xa0When we don’t confront a sinning brother, we weaken the resolve of the whole church.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlso,\\xa0saving a soul from death, helping him to turn from the error of his way,\\xa0is a worthy reason for doing this.\\xa0We\\xa0also\\xa0cover a multitude of sins, which means that the sinning stops instead of it continuing and being exposed before others.\\xa0\\nWhy Don’t We Speak the Truth in Love?\\xa0\\nThe first reason we don’t speak the truth in love is fear of man. We are afraid of losing friendships or straining relationships. Unfortunately, this just compounds\\xa0our\\xa0own\\xa0sin. In Galatians 1:10, Paul warns us that if we are man-pleasers, we are not servants of Christ.\\xa0\\nAnother reason we don’t speak to others when it is needed is because of fear of rejection. It’s possible that we’ll be labeled as judgmental or self-righteous.\\xa0When this\\xa0happens, we can take great comfort in 1 Peter 2:21-24.\\xa0\\nA further\\xa0reason we don’t speak the truth in love is because we fear not knowing what to say. While this concern is legitimate, it’s one that can be easily remedied by being prepared. Paul is clear in Romans 15:14\\xa0that all believers are able to help each other, and\\xa0in 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul tells us how to be ready for this task.\\xa0We are competent to counsel, but we must know what the Word of God says so that we know\\xa0how to\\xa0address each situation.\\xa0\\nWhere Do We Speak the Truth in Love?\\xa0\\nWe must speak the truth in love to our own hearts.\\xa0Proverbs 27:19\\xa0says,\\xa0“As in water face reflects a face, so a man’s heart reveals the man.”\\xa0How can we help someone else if we aren’t being honest with ourselves first? Are we seeing clearly or are we clouded by bitterness or resentment?\\xa0(See Matthew 7:1-5).\\xa0We must speak the truth in love in our homes.This certainly does not mean that I have to speak my mind on every subject that comes up in a given day.\\xa0But it does mean that if a child or a spouse or anyone else living in the home has an ongoing pattern of wrong attitudes or actions, then\\xa0I am\\xa0to\\xa0address it.\\xa0\\xa0We must speak the truth in love in our houses of worship.This would include anyone who belongs to Christ. We have cited Matthew 18 already, so suffice it to say that when there is an offense, we have a responsibility to go to that person, and then make sure we follow through the steps if there is no repentance.\\xa0We must speak the truth in love in our hostile world.Please know that practicing this will no doubt incur persecution and hatred.\\xa0Jesus has given us full warning of this in John\\xa015:18-25.\\xa0\\nHow Do We Speak the Truth in Love?\\xa0\\nWe should\\xa0pray before, during, and after\\xa0our conversation with them. Pray that God would open their heart to hear truth, pray\\xa0while you’re speaking that your words would not fall on deaf ears or a hard heart, and pray afterward that the dear Holy Spirit would do the work of conviction of sin and lead them to repentance.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCoupled with prayer\\xa0is patience,\\xa0as Paul says in 1\\xa0Thessalonians 5:14.\\nWhat is the Result of Speaking the Truth in Love?\\xa0\\nPaul gives us\\xa0several results\\xa0in 2 Timothy 2:25-26.\\xa0The first fruit\\xa0mentioned\\xa0is repentance, which is a turning from sin.\\xa0Paul mentions another result\\xa0is\\xa0that the person\\xa0we’re speaking to may come to their senses. This means\\xa0to\\xa0change their thinking\\xa0like one awakened out of a deep sleep.\\xa0Another result\\xa0is to\\xa0escape the snare of the devil. This\\xa0is a reference to his tricks.\\xa0Many do not realize they are\\xa0being held captive by the evil one.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Speaking\\xa0the truth in love” is\\xa0a popular phrase which is used often in Christian\\xa0circles, but are we\\xa0actually doing it effectively for the glory of God?\\xa0Speaking the truth in love in a post-truth world\\xa0is\\xa0challenging, but a wise Christian will remember the wisdom of Solomon’s words\\xa0in Proverbs 8:7,\\xa0“For my mouth will speak truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nThis material is taken from a longer work published by Focus Publishing; Speaking the Truth in Love in A Post Truth World.

      "{'title': 'Gracious Words Amid Sword Thrusts', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Jim Koerber', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Communication 11', 'question': 'Are your words gracious gifts that land pleasantly on the one listening or sources of grumbling and disputing?', 'body': 'We’ve probably all heard the phrase, “sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me!” While there is a healthy bit of defiance in this statement, we know deep down that this is simply not true. In fact, the writer of Proverbs would strongly disagree with this phrase when he says:\\n“There is one whose rash words are like sword thrusts.” (Proverbs 12:18a)\\nNo doubt if you took some time to do it (and I don’t recommend it) you could probably come up with some moments in your past when you received such “sword thrusts.” I still remember Susan in line at school calling me “big ears” and an authority figure declaring when I failed at a task, “I knew you would do that.” Sword thrusts! By the way, Susan apologized to me later! If we are honest we must acknowledge that at times we have delivered a few “sword thrusts” for which we have hopefully repented.\\nThe swords have been out since the beginning of March when talk of “pandemic” proportion illness entered our lives. There has been a lot of harsh communication. Seemingly endless press conferences, 24 hour news reporting, political posturing, and social media posting take on the feel of a never ending din. Much of this is filled with “sword thrusting!”\\nAs ambassadors of the Kingdom of a Resurrected Savior, we have an opportunity to use our once unclean lips, now made clean, for the proclamation of a Resurrected Savior! Click To Tweet\\nBeloved, let this not be said of us. As ambassadors of the Kingdom of a Resurrected Savior, we have an opportunity to use our once unclean lips, now made clean, for the proclamation of a Resurrected Savior! Paul writing to the citizens of this Kingdom had this to say,\\n“Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.” (Philippians 2:14–16)\\nThese are Gospel Imperatives\\nDo all things without grumbling or disputing. This is reminiscent of the people of Israel wandering in the wilderness. Grumbling and disputing are not Gospel-oriented. In fact, this “doing all things” probably relates to the “working out your own salvation with fear and trembling” seen in the prior paragraph (vv. 12-13). Our current situation may tempt us to grumble and dispute like the tribes of Israel in the wilderness. But grumbling and disputing know nothing of the fear and trembling that should be present in our “do[ing] all things…” Grumbling and disputing are signs of dissatisfaction in God and an arrogance that says, “I know better than God.” In fact, such arrogance is an echo of the hiss of the serpent in the garden. Fear and trembling, on the other hand, are signs of humility and seriousness with our tongues. These tongues, given to us by the Holy, Holy, Holy God of Isaiah 6 require God’s forgiveness and grace so that we can shine as lights in the world. He has so we can!\\nThis fallen, often war- and plague-stricken world is a dark place. When Paul calls us to shine as lights, we are called to be bearing witness of the One who is the light of the world, Jesus Christ (John 1:5; 8:12). We too, shine as lights if we are not grumbling or disputing.\\nPaul tells us to “hold fast to the word of life.” This sufficient Word has much to say about how to use our renewed tongues for our assignment to be shining lights in this midst of the darkness of a twisted generation. For instance, Paul, writing to the believers (people with these renewed tongues) living under the dark shadow of the Temple of Artemis, gives instruction on how we are to speak:\\n“Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ, from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.” (Ephesians 4:15–16)\\nYes, we can discuss the merits of consequential decisions and what’s happening in the world around us, but we must do it in love. This also means the topic of our discussions has a higher truth purpose—to point to a far greater hope than wise decisions and hopeful statistics.\\n“Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.” (Ephesians 4:29)\\nPaul calls us to consider our words. So, before you hit “post” or share that catchy meme, do your words (or borrowed words) reflect sword thrusts? Grumbling and disputing? Corruption?\\xa0 Or a love for others? Are your words a gracious gift that land pleasantly on the one listening—winsomely directing their attention to the Light of the World?\\n\\nThis blog was originally posted at Slice of Grace, view the original post here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJim Koerber is an elder at Grace Covenant Church in Beavercreek, OH and a Fellow with ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Guarding Against Gossip', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 203', 'author': 'Caroline Newheiser  Dale Johnson', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Communication 11', 'question': 'The sin of gossip is bearing bad news behind someone’s back out of a bad heart.', 'body': 'Dale Johnson:\\xa0I am so excited to invite Caroline Newheiser to the podcast. She is an ACBC certified member, she just completed a Master of Arts in Christian Counseling at RTS in Charlotte, and she is the beloved wife of one of our board members, Jim Newheiser.\\n\\nWe are going to talk about the issue of gossip. In the world in which we live right now with both television and social media, we have so many opportunities to fall into this temptation, and even at church, as we talk to people, we find ourselves struggling with this particular issue of gossip. Before we deal with it, one of the things we have to say is, “What in the world is gossip, and how do we recognize it when we see it?”\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0Gossip has a negative tone. It is repeating information meant to slander, put someone in a bad light, or defame their character. One definition is, “The sin of gossip is bearing bad news behind someone’s back out of a bad heart.”\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0As we talk about gossip, we certainly see this as an issue throughout the Scriptures, and there are several biblical examples. What are some of those biblical examples about gossip?\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0I found in the book of Genesis the story of Noah and his sons. After Noah left the ark, he built a vineyard and became drunk. One of his sons tattled on him, reported what happened to the other brothers, but the two covered his sin. That is an example of negative gossip, but also how to respond to gossip: covering it.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0What are some of the effects when we find ourselves participating in gossip, when we engage in this activity that the Scripture tells us not to? I must confess, it’s something that for us as humans who are especially extroverted, we enjoy talking. We like to fellowship with one another. It is something that in our culture, we find ourselves more tempted to do or slipping into more often than some other sins.\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0That’s right. A good question to ask oneself is, “Would I say this if that person were standing right here? Would I be talking like this?”\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, that’s right. Sometimes we have conversations, and we feel free to say things about someone that we’re not 100 percent certain of. We’re not sure if this were true about them, and it’s certainly something that we wouldn’t say if they were standing right there with us.\\nLet’s talk Scripturally about some of the things that God calls us to relative to the way that we talk. We know from Scripture, especially as biblical counselors, that there are certain ways that we try to fight against sins. It’s not just saying, “Well, I shouldn’t talk bad about people,” or, “Well, I shouldn’t spread gossip.” We know that God calls us to obey certain things. What are some of those things in the Scripture that God calls us to obey that can help prevent us from engaging in the sin of gossip?\\nCaroline Newheiser: Proverbs 18:17 says, “The one who states his case first seems right until the other comes and examines him.” We need to recognize that there are two sides to a problem. This is important in counseling because you may hear one side of the case and that person wants to convince you that they are right, and yet, you need to be aware to help others by listening to the other side. We also want to realize that with many words, transgression is unavoidable. Like you already mentioned, it is a sin that comes out of a heart of looking at the negative side of someone. So to protect our hearts, we want to move into, “Lord, change my heart so that I can not have to control myself so much with my words, it’ll come out naturally positive speech.” Like Ephesians 4:29, “Let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but only what is for edification building up others according to the need of the moment.”\\nDale Johnson: You know those awkward moments when you’re engaged in conversation with someone and you can tell this is going in a direction where a gossip is right on the cusp and they’re beginning to go down that road to gossip? What do you do in situations like that? What are ways that we, in normal, informal fellowship with other people, can stop this process of gossip?\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0That’s a great question. I like it because we want to talk about what to do practically. One thing you could say is, “I don’t really need to hear about this,” or, “Let’s talk about something else; I don’t need to know that,” or, “You’re really speaking negatively about someone, so have you spoken with them about it?” which is the Matthew 18, you go and talk to your brother first before you tell others.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Most of the time when we speak negatively about someone else, it’s often because that’s a disposition of our heart. That’s the way we’re looking at other people. One of the ways that we can help to change even our own hearts and the hearts of those that we work with is, instead of being negative about all the things that they see, begin to think about things from a positive perspective. Begin to look at what God has done that is good in that person or what God has done that is helpful from that person. What are some Scriptures that tell us to think about people in that way?\\nCaroline Newheiser: First\\xa0Corinthians 13:7 says, “Love hopes all things.” I take that to mean you put the best spin on what they are saying or their motives. Gossip is talking a lot about motives. We think we know why somebody did something, and yet, the Lord says to speak truth to one another; He is truth.\\nDale Johnson: One of the things that you’re saying there is, when we gossip, we’re actually acting as though we’re the judge of all the earth; we have made this judgment call on what we believe to be true about that person in that particular moment. We know the truth about who God is, and that’s His role. Talk for a second about His role as the judge in matters just like this.\\nCaroline Newheiser: That’s a good term. “Judge not lest you will be judged in the same manner.” That’s Matthew 7. We are not to stand in judgment, and that’s why we love gossip. We love to judge people, and that puts us above everyone else around us. That’s one reason it’s such a temptation.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Let’s take this to the counseling room. You have a lady, and it’s probably some other issue that’s brought her into the counseling room with you, and let’s say you can tell she’s dealing with this issue of gossip. She believes the most negative thing about people and she likes to share that, oftentimes, to excuse her own desires and things that she wants to do. What are some helpful things that you try to walk her through to overcome this issue of gossip?\\nCaroline Newheiser: We want to begin with Scripture, and there are plenty of Scriptures that talk about how negative gossip is. It’s one of the six things that God hates. On the positive side, Psalm 19:14 says, “Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in your sight, O God.” We’re giving her tools to\\xa0help her fight this sin by thinking God’s thoughts, and God is truth.\\nDale Johnson: That’s right. Now, let’s flip this around and look at it from the other direction. I know we’ve talked, in brief, about women who are afraid that they might gossip, so they don’t tell things that are actually true. There are true things that they may need to tell someone else. How does a woman know what is gossip and what is not, and when she’s not gossiping, when she’s telling something that’s true, that maybe is happening in her home that’s not righteous, good, or helpful?\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0That’s a good question because our conference is about abuse, and a lot of women are afraid to tell what’s happening because they don’t want to speak badly about their husbands. A counselor should assure her that the only people who will know are the people who can help, so some abuse needs to be mentioned so that leadership in the church or a counselor can help her work through it, and it’s for the purpose of restoration like Galatians 6:1. I’ve emphasized that you want to restore your husband, you know he’s not walking with Christ. This is a way we can do it. We will help you.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Sometimes we’re the ones who are being gossiped about and man’s words can be really tough to deal with, especially words that we know are untrue. It can affect us emotionally in the way that we think about others, and the way that we respond. How do we deal with situations when other people may be gossiping about us? What hope do we have there?\\nCaroline Newheiser: When a woman comes to me with this situation, I bring her to Psalm 26:1 where David says, “Vindicate me O Lord for I have walked in my integrity and I’ve trusted in the Lord without wavering.” I pointed to the fact that God knows. God knows her heart and if she is accused falsely, then the Lord knows, and that’s the most important aspect anyway. Because we lose sight of God in all of this when we get involved as people. Also, Jesus Himself was slandered. He was accused of wanting to take down the temple in three days and rebuild it, and cannibalism because people did not understand, “Eat my flesh and drink my blood.” He also endured, and we can follow His example. Jesus did not defend Himself before the Pharisees. He just stated truth and He died for sins of gossip, which we need to realize how heinous the sin is.\\nDale Johnson: That’s a great point. This is a sin that is easy for people to commit, it’s a sin that is common for all of humanity, but it’s still a sin that God viewed it enough to place it on Christ, demonstrating His wrath against sin. We’re not dealing with something that we should make common.\\nCaroline Newheiser:\\xa0That’s right. I think that’s an important point to make, because gossip is so destructive. It ruins families, it ruins churches, and it affects the biblical counseling to some extent. We have all faced false accusations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nCommunication\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline Newheiser is the Assistant Coordinator of Women’s Counseling at Reformed Theological Seminary – Charlotte.

I am so delighted to have Pastor Rick here, not just as my personal pastor here in the Kansas City area, but also for his many years of faithful shepherding and pastoral influence. What a great personal relationship we’ve begun to build and friendship. It’s been a refreshing relationship, Rick, and I’m grateful for you and the ministry of Mission Road Bible Church, the way that you guys minister to us as a family, I’m just so grateful. I look forward to our conversation today. Not an easy one, not a simple one. \\nLet me tell you a little bit more about Rick. He’s been married to Kim for 26 years, and they have three boys, and those guys are cool. There is another now that has taken their place, I suppose, a grandchild and his name is Charlie, a few months old. I love to hear Rick talk about Charlie. It’s one of my favorite things—the delight of a grandfather, especially with a first grandchild.\\xa0\\nWe’re going to dive into this. We’re going to talk about some of these divisive opinions. We’ve been doing this whole post-pandemic thing for a while now. The pandemic for 15 months, and it seems like we’ve been coming out of this to some degree or another for quite some time. One of the things that I’ve thought about through this whole process is early on it seemed like your churches that were struggling, the pandemic had a massive impact early on. Then, as we move forward, some of your conservative, stronger churches were handling that well. People were unified. Yes, there’s a lot of unknowns. We’re not sure what’s going on. We’re not sure of the narratives. We’re going to take all the protocols and do the things that are necessary and that sort of thing. Honestly, it seems like it’s a little bit more difficult even for stronger churches at this stage in the game. People have formed their opinions about what they think is happening, based on science and what doctors are saying, their opinions about vaccinations. All this stuff is coming to bear, and here we are in different places trying to open back up. Some to differing degrees, and you guys as elders, I’m telling you, not just at Mission Road, but elders broadly, you guys are taking a beating to some degree on so many decisions. And it’s like, you can’t win for losing, it seems that any decision you make, somebody’s not going to be excited about it, certainly. \\nLet’s talk about some of those divisive opinions, and we’re not assuming here that people are sitting back twiddling their thumbs waiting to pierce the elders with some sort of divisive opinion that they have, that they’re holding these things strongly. They’re not necessarily corroborating on how they can tear unity down. They just hold these opinions strongly. Let’s talk today about how we shepherd those types of things, and you guys, as elders, certainly have had those types of discussions. Let’s begin here. What are some of the most critical things that you guys have had to encounter? And these are well-meaning people, but they fall on different sides of some issues. What are some of those issues that you guys are seeing now are difficult things to navigate post-pandemic?\\nRick Holland:\\xa0Well, it’s the right question that we’re asking weekly. We have a meeting from 5:30 to 7:00 every Friday morning with our elders. And we’ve talked about this, for now, 15 plus months. First, let me say we love having you and Summer and your family in our church as well. Glad God has brought you to us. What we’ve had to navigate from day one in this is sourcing authority. What I mean by that is we all believe in Mission Road in the sufficiency of Scripture and seeing God’s Word as our only source of authority. And yet, there are competing voices daily on the news, on Facebook, on Twitter, on social media, with a family member, with the internet. Science and society have leaked into Scripture, and those two pools of source material have caused people to become social experts and scientists. Then that puts us as elders in the position of kind of navigating that. We’ve told people from day one that we are not social politicians. We are not scientists, but we are biblical. And we want to say what the Scripture says, all that Scripture says, and no more than what the Scripture says about these issues. And that becomes very difficult with a multitude of opinions on all these issues on vaccines, on meeting, on masks, and we had to decide very early on, Dale. This was so encouraging with our elders that we wanted to do what was biblical and right. Not what would garner consensus, because there is no consensus, you said it. No matter what we decided, someone was on the other side of that decision. So we had to justify those decisions by, does this honor Christ and honor our responsibilities to the government and to our people?\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0But at some point, you’re right, you have to make a call, right? You have to make some decisions, and sometimes it may or may not be popular. That sort of leads to the next question. You’ve got pastors out there who are feeling that pressure. They’ve sort of may be too late, as long as they possibly can and may be deferred as long as they possibly can, but they’re having to make some decisions. For better or worse, the Lord has put them in that place to make these types of decisions, and inevitably you’re going to have people who disagree. So, as an elder or as a group of elders, how do you guys navigate that when you make these decisions? The people who disagree. How do you engage them? How do you approach them? How do you deal with them regarding these decisions as you gather back again?\\xa0\\nRick Holland:\\xa0Yeah, we’ve had to do that both publicly and privately. But by publicly, there are some statements that we’ve made public. For example, when we’re under a mask mandate in Johnson County, we asked people to wear a mask. We said early on, masks don’t make us sin, and masks don’t cause us to cease worship, so we can do that. And the example was a friend I have who’s a missionary in an Asian country. I can’t say any more than that. And he goes to visit churches. If you would have told him that all of the churches, the underground churches he’s meeting with, they could meet publicly, openly, and without persecution, and all they had to do was wear a surgical mask, they would have been ecstatic. And yet we have these, you know, we’re Americans; we have rights. No one’s going to tell me what to do, which works nice in a mask situation, although they can get a ticket going 35 in a 25 zone. The government tells us what to do all the time. It’s just a matter of where we want to kind of mark those out. But when people disagreed, we would say things publicly. \\nFor example, you were there probably a few weeks ago, regarding vaccines. We were asked constantly, what do the elders believe? What is their position on vaccines? We said, talk to your doctor and make a good decision. We’re not scientists. Don’t listen to the internet, don’t listen to Facebook, talk to your doctor, let the expert tell you that. But we still have a multitude of emails that have come in on what we should and shouldn’t be doing. The hardest part, and the most glorious part at the same time, is to drive people back to what are the biblical parameters for these decisions regarding your heart, your sanctification, your understanding of safety, your understanding of security, your understanding of what the expectations of living in a broken world are? How can you love God, love others, and be responsible before the Lord, obey Romans 13 and stay inside the biblical parameters in the covers of your leather Bible and not the opinion and gossip that’s on Facebook?\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I think that’s so critical. I want to make a distinction here as we move into the next question, between those who disagree. Because pastors who are in this situation, they’re quite hyper-vigilant, honestly, about the decisions that they’re making, how their people are responding to it. There’s a difference between a congregant who disagrees with something and shepherding that person versus someone who has a divisive approach.\\nRick Holland:\\xa0Completely different. We’ve had people disagree with the policies that we’ve had at church, and they’ve done so very privately, very honorably. But then the people who begin, you know, the Sunday gossip session, and they try to gather a momentum of people. By God’s grace, we didn’t have that in His kindness over the course of the 15 months. But we did see people who we needed to have lunch with and just talk to. Interestingly, those two guys we really had to talk to about this, when it came down to it, it wasn’t so much policy-driven as fear-driven. And now we’re into biblical issues. What are you afraid of? Is that a legitimate fear? How does God meet that need? And how can you think rightly about your own safety, your own security, the transitoriness of this life, the temporality of this life, and the permanence of the gospel to get back to those core issues. I think Satan is very clever to get us on the tangential issues, which looked like the big issues. Masks, vaccines, those are just fruit, not root. To go back to how am I thinking about these? So, in those individuals who disagree, we tried to shepherd them back to the real issue here, and it was rarely masks or vaccines. There were underlying issues that were related to those.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I think one of the critical things that you said, most people might sort of gloss over, is no matter if someone is disagreeing, you’re having a dialogue. That’s how you are shepherding them, and you’re working with them through that. So you’re seeing those people, still, honor what you guys are saying as elders, and that’s healthy. We shouldn’t get defensive or respond unnecessarily to folks like that. But when you do see these types of divisive categories or characteristics, it’s important that you as elders do not just assume what these people are thinking and that you go and approach them—not in angry response or accusatory ways but to go and investigate. Find out what’s going on. What are the things that you’re afraid of? What are the things that you’re concerned about? Hear their voice. That gives you the opportunity to shepherd them appropriately, knowing what stage is to do next. I think so many pastors and elders at this stage in the game sort of already assume that the lines are drawn, the camps are made, and they don’t engage their people. That’s missing a shepherding opportunity.\\nRick Holland:\\xa0That’s really important. It’s not about winning the debate with your detractors. It’s about a soul that is in turmoil over something. The disagreement’s just a smokescreen a bit—there are worldview and theological issues underneath those disagreements that have to be identified, unearthed, and addressed. What you’re talking about has been our goal. I love the way you assess it, it’s a shepherding issue, not a debate about the issue, and if you put them in the category of “You disagree and I need to win this debate,” you’re not going to get to the core issues of their heart or even yours. I mean, we’re not infallible, we have made decisions, we’ve had to call them all again or call an audible and say, we need to revisit this. We don’t assume that we’re always in the right in every decision either.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, and I think your people then sense\\xa0that humility and it’s a lot easier to be led by folks who demonstrate that posture as opposed to, “We’re in this position, we’re going to take the reigns and snatch you wherever people seem to respond better.” And it’s not that you don’t have to do that at times. I’m not saying that. I’m just saying there’s a way you shepherd and guide people from a disposition of wisdom. Let’s talk about some of these types of issues. I want to sort of dive in, not just what issues you have to deal with but really the processes that you guys as elders have gone through in how you go about making decisions, right? As you talked about, we want to make decisions that fall within the binding of our leather Bibles. And if that’s the case, walk us through sort of processes or how in a hierarchy, how you’re thinking about the truths of Scripture that helped you guys to make decisions wisely to then present them to your people.\\xa0\\nRick Holland:\\xa0Yeah, we had literally, and I really mean this, hours, dozens of hours of conversations about this. It landed with two broad categories. Whatever decision we are making about whatever issue has to avoid sin. Whatever we’re doing cannot be sinning. For example, if the government told us, you cannot sing, we’re commanded to sing. That would have been an easy issue, so is it causing us to sin? But the second was, is this preventing us from worship? And that became more complicated because prevention can be a very subjective issue. I didn’t like singing with a mask, but that was a preference, not a prevention issue. So, does it make us sin? Does it keep us from righteous behavior? Those became our two parallel kinds of tracks that we were trying to run the train on, and they held very well for keeping us out of the ditch on both sides.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, as we think about the particular decisions and the process by which that happens, you sort of add another iron into the fire with modern technology—it’s easy. As you mentioned, you hearing news reports every day about what’s going on here and there, and with the internet, you can see what’s happening in other ministries, and other churches, other locations, and to some degree, pastors and elders are having to fight against what other ministries are doing. How do you guys take those things into consideration? How does that affect your processes of decision-making? And how do you land on the other side, as you’re thinking about shepherding your own people?\\xa0\\nRick Holland:\\xa0Well, that last phrase is where we landed. First Peter 5 says, shepherd the flock of God among you, and we recognized from the very first month of the pandemic that there were voices, national and international voices, that we respected, that were making calls and making judgments that whether we agreed or disagreed with is a separate issue. They were in different states with different regulations, different contexts, and we had to make a decision very early that we wanted to do what was best biblically for our own flock at Mission Road—knowing that sometimes would be going against other bigger, national voices. Interestingly, that became a real critical shepherding issue with people. “Well, what about so-and-so who said such and such?” And we had to shepherd them through to say, “Well, it’s a different context, different church, different city, different county, different state.” Our minds were so occupied with shepherding the folks at 7820 Mission Road that we couldn’t keep up with every other pastor’s opinion, and we had to stay in our lane in our church.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I think that’s one of the things that I could say objectively that you guys did super well. You were able to affirm those decisions in those places because they are different contexts and yet still be convictional, biblical, help people understand the biblical parameters as you guide the people here. Quite honestly, I mean, those are the people you and the rest of the elders will be responsible for, and I want to say that to pastors. You’re not responsible for every believer that walks on the planet. You’re responsible for those people who have joined with you in fellowship at your location, and I think that’s super critical for you to think through. One last question that I want to get, maybe just very practical. Let’s say you receive a phone call or some guy who’s a pastor in another place and he’s asking these questions, and he’s pouring his heart out, “Rick, man. It’s been really difficult. We’re tired.” Maybe he’s in a location where there are only a few elders, and he can’t spread the workload out a lot, and he’s weary and tired, and his people are weary and tired. They’re not overly defensive or specifically divisive, they are just all weary of everything that’s been going on, and he begins to ask you some questions about how to navigate this. You can just tell that he’s weary. Where do you begin? How do you start to help, to encourage a pastor in a situation like that?\\xa0\\nRick Holland:\\xa0Yeah, that’s the right question, and I think you do so corporately, and you do so privately. What we as pastors say from the pulpit is important because that’s your biggest shepherd’s crook. So to be principle-driven, to be heart-driven, to be book-chapter-verse-driven is very important so that people see what you’re doing and why you’re doing it and what you’re not doing and why you’re not doing. It is important. But I think drilling down a little bit more. It’s the one-on-one with a couple, a dad, a mom, a husband, a wife who are having a lot of heartburn over issues. That’s counseling. That’s discipleship. That’s where you now have a dialogue with someone. And you can unearth what’s going on in their heart. Identify where the missteps are, the misapplication of theology, the misappropriation of theology, the misunderstanding of theology, and do some heart work, some correction work there. I think it takes both. You have to be public and for the corporate dimension of the body so that everyone is hearing the same message. Not everyone’s objections or issues are identical. So that’s where the one-on-one, you said it a minute ago so well, that conversation. Praise God for being able to sit across the couch or across the table from someone and say, “Why do you believe what you believe, and is that biblically sound in how you’re thinking?”\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0That is the work of the ministry. Sometimes in our modern sense, we measure these ministry issues by nickels and noses, and we measure ministry by a thousand other things. The reality is, these are the ways in which ministry matters scripturally, when we’re walking people through some of the wrestlings of their own heart. And right now, the discussion happens to be couched in the language of the pandemic and the fears, anxieties, worries, concerns, freedoms, and rights that people experience through this. I think those are wise words for us to consider, and I pray for pastors that they take encouragement in how they go about shepherding their people even on this side of the issue that we’ve been dealing with.\\n\\nFor more information about TEAM Focus Ministries for weary and tired pastors, contact us at info@biblicalcounseling.com.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nConflict\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'Perseverance for the Believer When There is Resistance to Reconcile', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Tim Keeter', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Conflict 17', 'question': 'We want to be a tangible representation of gospel love.', 'body': 'For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Tim Keeter. I am a lay elder, not on staff, at my church. My church family who I love is Grace Community Church in Huntsville, Alabama. I am a full-time engineer, so if you know anything about Huntsville, that’s not a big deal. There’s\\xa0a lot of us there. It’s a pretty nerdy town, but there is a work-life balance between ministry and work, and I am so thrilled that I get to be a part of this type of ministry in our church. It is a part of how our church operates. Our leadership leads in this area, and our people understand and appreciate the role of counseling. It’s not just some separate thing that we do. It’s really a part of how we approach Scripture and a part of how we minister it to one another, not just from the leadership down.\\nI want to encourage you—if you feel like a voice crying in the wilderness where you’re getting this, but you’re not really sure, or if it’s catching on around you—be faithful, submit to your leadership, go to them in humility and encourage them to look into these things, and use what you walk away with here. If this is your first time here or you’ve been coming several times, use what you have and love people with it. Seek to be more faithful; seek to grow. I want to leave you with some things that you can use.\\nThat’s my purpose today and I want to talk to you about those situations when we have relationships—especially close relationships—that are very meaningful and that become severely damaged, and through the course of whatever is going on it gets to a point where it just doesn’t look like reconciliation is going to occur. Like marriages that would end in divorce, close friendships, or maybe a sibling or even a child that has just gone off the deep end in rebellion and hardness of heart; or relationships inside the church that have endured for years and that have been broken. The believer is hurt deeply; perhaps not just from being sinned against, but maybe over grief of how they’ve even contributed to it over the years or over the moments that have led to this point.\\nUnderstanding at the outset that this is a marathon, not a 50-yard dash and that we need to be committed to love these individuals, be there for them, not go anywhere, and encourage them in that capacity. I’m assuming at this point, as you’re walking through these things with them, that you’re working with them to address their logs in the matter. In Matthew 7, Christ tells us to look to ourselves first. I’m assuming that you’ve been doing that, that they have seen that, and that they’re seeking forgiveness—not perfectly—but that overall you see that the thrust of their life is now characterized by a desire to glorify God, to restore that relationship, to rebuild any kind of trust and strengthen it if at all possible, and hoping in that. But the problem is that whoever the other party is, they have moved on in their minds. They’re resisting—perhaps sinfully—any attempts to reconcile, at least in terms of a desire to put things back where they were. This other party still feels the pain of the broken relationship in almost all cases, but rather than what Ken Sande would call “peacemaking,” they are either “peacefaking” by fleeing the situation or they’re just turning to attacks and what he would call “peacebreaking.”\\nThis workshop today is based on a couple of different case studies. I want to walk you through a couple case studies with two men in particular that I’ve had the privilege to become friends with and to know who have experienced this situation with their wives—now ex-wives. I want you to walk away with three different things in particular:\\xa0\\n1) Different counselors can draw from the same Bible, but will creatively apply these truths in different ways. I was not the primary counselor in at least one of these cases. We can accomplish the same goal by creative application.\\xa0\\n2) Similarly, there are different believers. These two men are in different places in their spiritual maturity, and you’ll see that these two men will cling to different combinations of biblical truth as anchors in their lives. We don’t want to walk into anything with the mentality of “Oh, yeah. I’ve seen this before.” We want to be humble. We want to listen. We want to love. We want to enter into the struggle with them. We want to think through things.\\n3) Even though these two cases are not a comprehensive treatment necessarily or an agenda, I want these principles to be tools that you can add to your toolbox.\\xa0\\nWhat I’ve done was such a blessing, even with the pain. I’ve gone back and sat with these men on multiple lunches a year and a half or more after the situation had not resolved and ended the way it did. I walked back through the situations from the initial point of revelation of, “Hey, there’s a problem here,” all the way up through the end and through where they are today. I explored with each of them the question: What was it that really encouraged you to be faithful at each stage along the way? I have five little things from each case study about what brought them comfort that I’d like to flesh out a little bit. These are things we want to explore. These are things that we want to make sure to emphasize with different people.\\xa0\\nI’ve given you a reference as well at the beginning to what we call “authentic suffering.” This is something that Steve Viars has coined in his book: It’s Not Always Sin: Bringing about Healing to Those who Suffer. Excellent book, excellent resource. I commend it to you. In particular he had a talk on that in 2011 for ACBC that you can go look up if you want the short version of it as opposed to the book.\\nYou can see that when others are suffering, we certainly want them to repent of any sin that they’ve had in the process and move towards an authentic biblical suffering where they are understanding that they can be honest with the Lord. We look at Asaph in Psalm 73 and see that Asaph is bringing his questions and angst to God, not in a way to somehow assign fault to God, but in more of a sanctified, “I don’t get it; I just don’t get it.” Admitting our weakness, admitting our failures, but while encouraging hope in God and sticking to sound theology.\\nWe’ll see how important dependence on our church family was in the lives of these two men. I hope that I can impress upon you how incredibly important that was and the importance of the preparation that brought about the relationships that stood firm when everything else in their life felt like they were on shaky ground. I think it’s important to encourage active ministry even as we suffer and, of course, encourage an eternal perspective. You’ll see elements of those in these two case studies.\\xa0\\nCase Study #1\\nSo let’s begin with a man that we’ll call Alan. That’s the first study. Alan is obviously not his real name, and with Alan’s permission, I’ve sifted out the things that are common to man. Alan was an elder in his church at the time. To shorten the matter a little bit, his wife drifted further and further away not just from him, but from interest in spiritual things and in the church, which grew from a drifting to a sort of bitterness against him. The church began to see that lack of interest, that engagement even during the sermons, but on the other side they saw an elevated interest in her appearance as she wore increasingly immodest dresses. Then they saw a desire for pursuing her own career. It was a sales-related type of career where she was away from home and from their two young children a lot on weekends and nights. It was also the type of career that had lots of office parties and celebrations when sales went well frequently throughout the year and involved extended hours alone with other men. This eventually led to adultery that wasn’t even revealed until well after the divorce, only fairly recently. I was brought in to come alongside another set of counselors and the leadership in Alan’s church.\\nI eventually developed a friendship with Alan that lasts even to this day. I hope we enter into those relationships expecting to become close. The world tells us to keep a safe professional distance, but the Bible says to love people, and that’s an encouragement to me. Alan is an encouragement to me, not just because we’ve been able to walk through this together, but because he loves the Lord and I need men like that in my life. I need to spend time like that with men who love the Lord.\\nLet’s look at how Alan responded during the process of realizing that things were really not good, but while he still hoped they would get better, and then during the painful process of seeing that the situation was just going to keep deteriorating. The situation went on for about a year to a year and a half.\\n1. He was comforted by submission to the church.\\nLet me expand on that a little bit. As an elder, Alan was usually on the other side of these types of situations. He was usually the one dealing with and diving into the sticky situations as well as leading. For the first time in his life, he was on the other side.\\nHe found a huge comfort in the ability to submit to church leaders. They weren’t perfect, but Alan realized that they loved God and they loved him. This is why it was important to Alan. Here’s a guy who for all practical purposes was filled with wisdom and understood the Word, was committed to the sufficiency of Scripture, understood how it applied academically to his own situation, but he was so caught up and so weakened, or faint-hearted or small-souled according to 1 Thessalonians 5:14. It was hard for him to even reason through what to do next. It was helpful for him to be able to look to these men and just say: “Tell me what to do. Help guide me.” Even though people like Alan may have been on the other side of the table at times, when you’re in the thick of it, it’s hard. It’s hard to think clearly and we need people who will come alongside us to help us and to guide us. It was difficult to submit not just to the leadership, but to the church, and to trust the process outlined in Matthew 18, even though his wife was the one who was persisting in her sin.\\nThey were not just unpacking all his wife’s stuff; they were unpacking his stuff and his home. That’s humbling. You can’t close that door and not let anyone in. Alan had to figuratively invite them inside his messy house, but he learned through the process to find comfort in and to embrace that humility because he saw that it increased his dependence upon God as well as his church family.\\xa0\\nWe’re looking at submission to the church, trusting the leaders to do what is right and to be qualified men who are walking with the Lord, seeking His counsel, and working together to think through these things. Because of the position he was in, this went to the leadership very quickly. There are situations in our church that maybe one or two elders know about, and by the time it gets to a larger stage we bring it before the rest of the elders. That’s a wisdom issue. In this case, it elevated very quickly because of his position. Alan found comfort in submission because they were people that the Lord had put in his life to help show him wisdom and to love him.\\n2. He was also refreshed by the friendships he had in the church.\\nWe want to encourage that at all times. Proverbs 18:1 says, “He who separates himself seeks his own desire and quarrels against all sound wisdom.” Other versions say, “he rages against all sound wisdom.” A tendency sometimes is to withdraw, especially if we’ve been the counselor, if we’ve been the elder. It’s humiliating. But our churches need to keep cultivating the culture that we suffer with one another. I think it’s helpful even just to articulate that when people are pouring out their hearts to you, just to let them know “we’re suffering with you; we love you.” As the church, we are the hands and feet of Jesus to our hurting brothers and sisters. It doesn’t need to just be the counseling arm; it needs to be the whole church. They don’t have to know all the details, but we know when we need to take up action and love those who are hurting.\\nThe flip side of that is that there were so many people holding Alan up during his weakness in this trial that he would have a tendency to think of it as a bother and a burden. All of these people had their lives going on; there were a lot of things going on, so he didn’t always want to ask for the help when he most needed it. He needed to be encouraged. It’s times like this—by the way—when it’s probably not the best choice to send a text message saying: “Hey, praying for you. Let me know if you need anything.” You see what I’m saying? We mean well and we may do that. But Alan had the most encouragement when men in his life would take the initiative to say, “Hey, listen, we’re doing lunch this week. When are you free? Let’s go to lunch. Let’s spend some time after work.” Don’t put the ball back in their court.\\nThat means that, as counselors in their lives, we may need to prompt other men or women as is appropriate to engage them. Maybe it’s just an another individual in your community group or your small group or women’s group. For example, you might just say, “We’ve been praying for Joan, but why don’t you see if she’s got an evening free or go find a way just to go sit and be a friend with her while she’s doing laundry Thursday night, just to be there because those are her loneliest times. Maybe you can just be a friend and don’t ask her to tell you when it’s okay. Sit down and figure it out; be there for her.”\\nThose are refreshing things and those in a weakened state don’t always think or feel like they have the wherewithal to ask for it. But we are meant to walk this Christian life in a community of faithful believers. We want to help men like Alan and women in situations like Alan to see the value of their church; there’s something to appreciate here. I’ve been in humbled situations where I depended heavily on others to serve my family and me. One of the things that was the most encouraging to me was to realize that this is so, so valuable and so important that my church—that Grace Community Church—when I was in my largest trial was being sanctified through my trial by a loving and wise Father that didn’t just pour this out on Tim for Tim to grow, and Tim to do this, and Tim to move towards Christlikeness; but He did it for my church and for them to step up and sacrifice, for it to cost them to love my family.\\nIt is good for Alan to realize and to be grateful for their sacrifice and service not just because it helped strengthen him, but because it helped strengthen his church family. It is good for our churches to be inconvenienced for those who suffer. That’s tangible. It’s even evangelistic in nature. We talk about John 13: “They will know you’re my disciples if you have love for one another.” We want to be a tangible representation of gospel love to our community and to unbelievers who are even in our churches to see how we love one another.\\nAlan was grateful throughout. It was an anchor to him that he had a deep bench of people that he could go to at any time not just for the superficial stuff, but the nitty-gritty. There’s a balance here too; it doesn’t always need to be every time you come over it’s a hard, heavy thing. Sometimes you just need to have a dude night. I’ve had friends where they were walking through some really, really hard things, and every Tuesday night when the kids got in bed we’d pull out\\xa0World War 2 DVDs of documentaries and things like that and just watch military things because that’s what we do in Huntsville. We watch military things, you just can’t get out of it; or NASA stuff. Just to nerd out over whatever.\\nMay this be said of all of our churches as well as ourselves. Are we cultivating these kinds of transparent relationships? It’s hard to bring them up at the last minute. But are we doing things as we progress through so that it is available when it’s needed? Because it is a valuable resource. I’m talking here to church leaders as much as I am to anyone. Are we being deliberate?\\nTo the others who are like Alan, I think Alan said, “I want other people in my situation to know not to let your trouble become your scarlet letter either.” Enter into those friendships, but those things don’t need to be something that silently defines your relationship with everybody else. We want to encourage people like Alan that we’re here because we’re your friend as well. I’ve had honest discussions with men before who said, “You know, I appreciate it. There are meals; there are prayers; lots of people are gathering around. What’s going to be happening in six to nine months from now when this is still an issue? Where’s everybody going to be?” That’s a good honest question.\\xa0And we need to keep reminding them: “Hey, we’re not going anywhere; we’re your church family; we’re your friends.” We may need to teach the flock and lead them by example and make sure that we stick with them, especially not losing them to bitterness and those types of things. The friendships and the church are super, super important. You’ll see this with the second case as well.\\xa0\\n3. Alan was strengthened by sound theology.\\nHe’s a teaching elder in his church. He understands, right? He doesn’t need somebody to reveal to him the mysteries of Romans 8:28-29,\\xa0but he needs to be reminded. We all need to be reminded. Some things that helped him the most in this area really had a lot to do with the way you help people understand their relationship to God and His character in this trial and who they are in God, for example.\\xa0Booklets and studies on authentic suffering are helpful. I think the thing that helped Alan the most was a book by Dave Harvey. I was talking to Jim Newheiser about this last night; it’s a book called Letting Go. (Dave wrote another book that I’m a huge fan of called When Sinners Say I Do. It’s a great marriage book and it doesn’t hold back any punches right out of the gate.) This is a book by Dave and I forget who the other author is, but if you look up Dave, you’ll find it; it’s called Letting Go:\\xa0Rugged Love for Wayward Souls. It’s broad. It’s not just for husband-wife relationships, but parent-child relationships, friendships, sibling relationships, and those types of things. I love that it’s written from pastors who have just seen this over and over again in their churches.\\xa0\\nI was going to share with you some amazing notes that I took in that book, but it is on an airplane probably somewhere in a back-seat pocket. So, if you’re going home on a Delta flight that has three seats on each side of the aisle and you sit in 28d, you may get a gift. I left that behind, but I will say that IBCD.org is a great reference if you do not have it bookmarked. They have a wonderful app as well if you’re an app kind of person. Jim has audio that is available on that website where he talks through this subject. I imagine you just search for Dave Harvey and you’ll find a number of resources. That’s a great resource. I have gone to IBCD.org many times. Have you ever come away from a counseling situation like, “Okay, this is a little bit new and I need to make sure I’m thinking biblically about this”? Please make IBCD.org one of your stops. Things are common to man and they have brought in a number of wonderful speakers. There are transcripts if you’re a reader rather than an audio person. You’ll find this resource on there if you want the short version of what that book has to offer.\\nAlan was encouraged by this. In his words, he said, “It just kind of helped me realize I wasn’t crazy.” This is what he meant by that: This had a grounding effect for him because in this particular situation his now ex-wife was just in attack mode: peacebreaking, constant criticism, constant blaming, finding fault, saying, “It’s your fault that we are where we are and it can’t be fixed.” That will wear you down. That’s a war of attrition. Because Alan sincerely loved her, he wanted to consider the criticisms that were constantly being launched at him, but he was worn down by the accusing and the blaming. Dave reminds us in his book that we can also become tempted to acquiesce in order to try to keep the peace and to somehow keep the marriage intact.\\xa0But when we do that, all we’re doing is allowing them to persist in their sin without the sting of consequences. That is not actually a loving thing to do. Dave’s book helps think through that.\\nEven though Alan was acutely aware of his wife’s sinful thinking and approach—her desires, her words, her pursuits—he needed those reminders of what his responsibility was and that she was indeed in rebellion against God.\\n4. He was humbled by hope in God.\\n“Love believes all things, love hopes all things, love bears all things.”\\nWe know for a fact that any relationship can be reconciled. There is no brokenness, there’s no line that we can cross where God’s grace does not restore; but we also don’t want to put our hope in those things. We want our hope in God. Just like when we get an unwelcome diagnosis, we don’t want to put our hope in statistics of how effective treatments are or even in the doctors and how good this particular group at this particular clinic is. Our hope is to be anchored in Christ. That God knows what he’s doing and that everything God does is, by definition, good—everything.\\nAlan was stripped of so many things that he enjoyed as a husband and a father in a very callous, fairly quick fashion. In those dark moments, those evenings—I say this as if it’s a bad thing—all Alan really had left in those times was Christ. In those moments when we realize that all we have left from the things that we would normally take comfort in and take assurance and refuge in—our families are good refuges to go home to, I’m not denying that—but in those moments we are left with the fact that Christ needs to be enough. He is our portion, and He is enough.\\xa0\\nSpeaking back to the friendships, this is our sacrifice as well to offer those times up to say: “Listen. I don’t care what time it is when you’re really, really struggling. Don’t wait until our next meeting time to call me, especially if you’re in the throes and the heat of battle. Don’t sin against God; step aside and call me. I would rather lose an hour of sleep than for you to sin against God. Let me pray for you. Let me just encourage you.” There were times when he would call and just say: “You know, I know what needs to be said. I just know I’m not thinking right. Can we talk for a second?”\\nJust be encouraged to stay the course. Sometimes we start to question things when the outcome is not really working the way we want it to: “There must be another way. This isn’t working.” What’s happened is that our goal has just drifted from glorifying God to, “I want the right outcome.” It’s a good desire but it has become an unholy desire because it is affecting our joy. We’re beginning to question God’s faithfulness.\\xa0\\nI want to talk about the times when there might be other creative ways to apply biblical truth, the times when we were just tempted to do whatever it takes to keep the peace, to do whatever it takes to bring her back when that is not a goal that God can bless. Those are humbling times too, when our ideas and our plans don’t just diverge from God’s, they sharply diverge. “God loves the family. God loves harmony in the home and I’ve got none of that right now.”\\xa0We’re forced to pray with our counselees with tears, “Let Christ be enough. Let Jesus be enough for us.”\\xa0\\nThose are big agendas: humility and gratitude. They’re huge agendas.\\nJeremiah Burroughs wrote a book titled The Rare Jewel of Christian Contentment. I’m pretty sure if I had left that book in the backseat, it would have been returned to me promptly because that book is thick to get through. That’s an old Puritan classic and it’s not one you just casually sit and read through. Jeremiah Burroughs said it’s not just about being pleased with God but being pleased with what God does.\\nI like 2 Corinthians 1:3 where God is the Father of mercies and God of all comfort. There is nothing that we can take comfort in that’s really comfort apart from the person Himself of our Father. He is the God of all comfort. Verse 5 after that says our comfort is even abundant through Christ.\\xa0If we want people to be comforted, we point them to their Father. We point them to Jesus.\\nFinally, the fifth point that Alan wanted me to share with you all. This was more along the back side of this in the aftermath, after the wreckage had gone on. He was seeing where things were, still hopeful one day for reconciliation, I would imagine,\\xa0but he was focused.\\n5. Now his main focus was to be faithful in “the new normal.”\\nI got this phrase from Bob Somerville’s book—excellent book on depression, by the way—If I’m a Christian, Why Am I Depressed. What Bob was pointing out in his book was with all the things that go on as we age, and other things that happen to us medically even, or things that go through our bodies, sometimes we have to realize that those parts of things are not going to change and are not going to go back to “normal.” We have a new normal: the way I’m functioning now.\\nBehavior and heart issues aside, in a sense Alan now has a “new normal,” and he needs to not become overly focused on trying to fix too many things as much as on: “What does faithfulness look like now?” This is now his new normal and it’s messed up compared to where he was. There are all kinds of weird complications, right? He has restrictions even on where he can live because of the children and the school zones; they’ve got joint custody so he can’t move outside the school zone where she’s decided they’re going to live. There’s a lot of fears of how things are going to be playing out with the children, especially.\\nIt’s helpful for Alan to be reminded: What does faithfulness look like now? As Martha Peace says: if these fears of mine do play out, God will give me the grace to deal with it at that time. But right now, what does faithfulness look like? What does a godly father do in these situations? He has kids that are now split between homes that have very different rules and very different spiritual practices. It’s easy to want to get caught up trying to undo what happens at her house when they come; but instead, he needs to focus on the fact that what they need most of all from Alan is a godly father who redeems the time that he has with his kids.\\nIt’s also a challenge to uphold Ephesians 6:1-3 with the children to honor their mother as long as she’s not asking them to sin. When he doesn’t have them, he prays for them and he prays for her. When he does have them and they want to complain about how mom won’t let them do this, or mom did this, or mom got angry and did this, to teach them to honor their mother. Why? Because it is the Lord who commands that and therefore that is what is best for the children.\\nHe has a week on, week off with his kids, and\\xa0during his weeks off he’s really focused now and engaging other people in ministry and fellowship. He’s not afraid even to ask married men to meet him after hours just to hang out every now and then or to find ways to encourage and minister to others in his church. Focusing on being faithful in the new normal is where Alan is living now. There’s still pain there; he’s reminded of it constantly when he comes home to an empty apartment, when he’s writing, seeing the impact to finances and everything else that goes on, when he goes to work and he’s not doing the thing that he had trained to do\\xa0most of his life any longer.\\nCase Study #2\\nLet’s talk about Tom. Tom is in our church and was married for 15 years with two children. His family began attending our church a number of years ago, and he was growing and was doing extremely well. But like we see evidence of in 1 Corinthians 7, his wife wasn’t. His increased interest and energies towards learning and applying God’s word ultimately developed a lack of peace in the home, some irritation on her part, and possibly even animosity.\\xa0\\nSome of us men can be clueless; we don’t do subtle very well and we don’t get the hints like we probably should. When she revealed her desire to separate, it took him by surprise completely. He never saw it coming. And even then, Tom didn’t really think it would go anywhere.\\nTom did the right thing: he called an elder at our church for counsel. It was not just, “I’m just going to pick up the phone and call the guy I like the best” but it was the one who was part of his community group with whom he already had an existing relationship with in the men’s group. Again, it’s important to develop those environments where people feel safe bringing their hearts to you because they know that not only will you be wise, you will be trustworthy to hold it in your hands for them even in their most vulnerable moments.\\nI was not the primary counselor in this situation, but came in on occasion to assist. Overseeing the counseling ministry doesn’t mean that I do all of the counseling; it can’t mean that in our church. More often than not now, we’re about 300 people. There’s a number of people counseling in our church. I’m there to assist; I’m there to help develop agendas, especially when things get a little scary and the counselor is a new counselor; as well as to help train those who are working through certification; and, of course, to minister to those that the Lord brings upon my life to be the primary counselor for. This is one of those situations where the elder and his wife just felt a little stuck, and they asked me to come in to sit in with the session and lead a few of them.\\nThere were times when Tom would be out of town and she would call and reveal that she had developed a relationship with another man. Actually, this kept happening to Tom. It was another man and another man. It was more revelations and more revelations—some of them virtual, some of them physical. There were changes that were noticed on her social media: lots of pictures of her all of a sudden working out, glamour selfies, and all kinds of things, even on the way to church. Not to say that selfies are bad; but this was a remarkable difference where the focus was on her appearance, just to give you a few examples. It continued to go downhill.\\nI love Tom. I’m going to call keep calling him Tom on purpose, but it’s not his name obviously. The lunch where we covered most of the ground on this was just humbling for me to see his love for the Lord and where he is now. I’ve listed the five points from Tom for you here.\\xa0\\n1. He was revived by regular confession and repentance.\\nWe don’t respond perfectly to these things, do we? Tom felt like he had failed his wife initially. He cried for an entire day. This is not a guy that I see being a very emotional guy. We helped him write letters to her asking forgiveness for his logs, including not leading and loving her like he should have been all those years, assuring her that he still loved her and wanted to reconcile. He still expected things to work out. According to 1 Corinthians 13:7, love hopes and bears and believes and endures all things.\\nWhen he was sinfully angry, Tom understood that. He didn’t have to go through a whole workshop on anger. He knew his attitude was not right and Tom had to learn to confess. In doing that, he recognized that there was a war inside of him. Galatians 5:17 says: “The flesh sets its desire against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please.” And it can get weary failing over and over and over and over again. First John 1:9 says: “If we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” What do you tell the person who says: “I just keep failing in this area. I know I’m growing in my understanding; I’m catching it a little bit early; but God surely is just weary.” What do you tell them? Keep confessing. God loves to forgive. We want to show them what repentance looks like; we want to work with them to change and to put things in place; we want to help them mature in that area. But we have to understand that our God never tires of forgiving us. Praise the Lord for that.\\nSometimes it takes a while to recognize the harvest of the seeds we’re planting, but we don’t begin the process until we recognize it for what it is: confessing and turning from our sins, even if it seems like we’re doing it over and over and over again. Tom was revived by that regular confession because he saw it for what it was. He didn’t just wallow. We want to wallow sometimes in our sin, especially in circles where we teach the sovereignty of God, the ugliness of sin, and learning to hate it; but we want to recognize that the bitterness of our sin shows us the beauty of Christ and the sweetness of our Savior’s love. We want to teach them to move from that hatred of our sin, that recognizing of the evil that it is—it really is enmity against God—to our confession and learning to rejoice in God’s forgiveness.\\nWe’ve heard reference to 1 Timothy 1:15 where Paul says “I’m the chief of all sinners,” but he goes on in verse 16 to say because of that—I’m paraphrasing—I was shown the grace of Christ. You know what he does in verse 17? He just goes into a benediction, just flows right into worship.\\xa0That should be the process. That should be the flow of a right understanding, not just of our sin and God’s holiness, but of His wonderful forgiveness. That we rejoice in that; that we stand in that, realizing that His love for me, His commitment to me is not dependent upon those things. Do you know that God is more committed to your sanctification than you are to the passing pleasures of your sin? I’m thankful for that if you are a child of God. Tom could rest in that.\\n2. Tom was also restored by the faithful preaching of the Word.\\nWe have a lot of our sermons online, like you would expect. Our pastor, Paul Lamey, preaches through entire books of the Bible in an expository sense from one to the other. He doesn’t set the agenda; the Holy Spirit does. He tackles the hard passages, and he’s such a blessing to our church.\\nTom sought out and listened to sermons, seeking out those in particular that dealt with issues of forgiveness in the gospels, because Tom saw that it helped him reset to a 1 Corinthians 10:31 mindset of doing all to the glory of God, whatever you do. He was an immature-ish kind of believer who has begun growing, and I love this description he gave: glorifying God is one of the gospel’s defining characteristics. He got it. He got that the goal and thrust of his life, even in this trial, was to glorify God. I asked him why just listening to sermons was that important to him and he said, “Tim, the regenerated heart wants God. And where do we find God and learn about him? In His Word and in the faithful preaching of His Word.” He knew what it was to love God and to love His Word. This is why we are biblical counselors.\\nFaithful counseling from the Word to the heart of repenting believers leads them, not just to be restored, but:\\n3. To be motivated by the truth of the gospel.\\nTo give you some more context: we continued confronting Tom’s wife as she would at first come but not follow up, and she ended up going on a trip. We were confident that she was planning to meet with another man from other emails and chats, and we found apps that were specifically designed to assist in adultery and those kind of things. We’re just really glad that she was actually pretty bad at passwords and things like that. But when she returned from that trip, we had a setback. Tom—admittedly out of anger and manipulation—gave her an ultimatum, and said “Hey, if you’re not going to work on reconciling the marriage, I’ll pay for a duplex. Let’s move you out.” She called his bluff. There may be times when that’s an appropriate move to make. Tom’s concern was that he did that out of anger and manipulation. She accepted the ultimatum; she moved out. The counselor helped him to write a letter, certainly asking for forgiveness for his attitude, but also stating to her what repentance looks like. We’re calling her to repentance. What does it mean? There were three things in particular:\\n1) To quit her job since she was using her job in this particular situation to fuel her lust and I don’t want to go into details there;\\n2)\\xa0To replace her smartphone with a dumb phone or whatever you would call it; and\\n3) To focus on living as a Christian wife and mother.\\nHer response: “That’s just too much for me.”\\nAt this point Tom is daily in the gospel. This is what’s important. This is what Tom got out of this. He was still cycling through times of sinful anger, but we could at least see that it encouraged Tom by realizing that maybe his anger didn’t last as long; it wasn’t an all-day thing where he would just visualize in his mind this other man kissing his wife, but his anger would last for about an hour, and he would realize it was sinful and he would repent.\\nHe was comforted and strengthened by the truth of the gospel in his life. So naturally—get this—because of that, he felt compassion for his wife. She was ensnared in her sin. He was finding repentance. He was finding a merciful God, and she was not. She was ensnared in her sin; she was in active rebellion against God, who resists the proud.\\nHe strongly desired not just to get her back so they could go back to being “normal”—whatever that is—but he strongly desired to show his wife the comfort that the gospel brought to him. Those were the directions of his prayers. How do we pray for our enemies? How do we bless those who curse us? We desire for God to do good in their life. We desire for God to bring about repentance in their heart.\\nHis actions meant that he pursued that by trying to love her as Christ loved the church. The counselor worked through helping him think of practical ways given their particular situation at times when they were apart and when they were together. Even when they were together there were times when she moved into the garage at one point and wouldn’t sleep with him. So he was motivated by the gospel, not just for himself, because he wanted his wife to experience the comfort that he got.\\xa0\\n4. Focus by honest expectations of the struggle.\\nA little bit like Alan’s “new normal.” It means honestly understanding mentally where the struggle is really going to happen. In other words, Tom knew that he had heart work to do to prepare for a long, hard road of reconciliation from the beginning. His counsel included that. He had to fight images in his head of things that he imagined happened, seeing his wife do things that were just for him totally out of character throughout their entire 15 years together, finding lies and deceit, burner phones, emails, chats and all kinds of other things. You can see the effect of sin. Sin just ruins everything. You can see the irrationality of her thinking.\\nTom is learning some of the same lessons over and over every couple of months because his heart is cycling through this, though he was still expecting even at that point to rebuild. We kept finding revelations of conversations and inappropriate relationships with other men. Tom was on a long process of learning forgiveness, to have a desire to offer her forgiveness and to stand in the spirit of forgiveness in humility since she was not requesting it, but still to stand in that spirit eager like the Luke 15 father who was waiting, looking, and hoping. Tom said to me and I quote: “That requires unconditional love because she’s not asking for my forgiveness.” He said that as a reflection of the love that God has shown him even while he was an enemy of God. He made that connection in his mind, but he still continued to struggle with confusion and doubt. It’s really easy to ask yourself at a point like that, in the most intimate human relationship that we’re blessed with on this Earth (marriage): do I really know anybody?\\nHe needed frequent encouragement to trust God rather than mankind. We know Jeremiah 17:9 a lot: ‘The heart is deceitful above all things.” You know what comes before that? Some very important verses where the Lord says, “Cursed is the man who trusts in mankind and makes flesh his strength,”—and this is the other part—”and whose heart turns away from the Lord.” When we trust in mankind, when we desire for mankind to fill the things that only God can fill in our lives, our heart will turn away from the Lord. Like Paul wrote to the Galatians, right? “If I seek to please man, then I cannot be a bondservant of Christ.”\\nWe see the consequences of that in Jeremiah 17:6, but in verse 7, we see the contrast that “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord and whose trust is the Lord.” Our trust is in a person.\\nIt’s\\xa0so easy to make flesh our strength, our circumstances, the things that we think we need to calm back down and to make life normal again—whatever that is. But those things are deceitful. Our heart will turn away from the Lord. We may understand that. We all give the “Sunday-School-nod” in here and say “Oh, yeah, brother, we get it. Cursed is the man. Blessed is the man.” And yet we still choose. Why? We don’t need to be convinced of that. I don’t think Israel necessarily needed to be academically convinced of that. I mean they were this far along in the Old Testament by the time Jeremiah told them that. “Got it. Got it, prophet.” Then why do we do it? Because verse 9: “The heart is deceitful above all things.”\\nIt’s not just an academic problem. It’s not just: “Oh, we need to teach them some things.” We need to be reminded of that as counselors. It requires miracles in the heart; it requires trusting the Lord and making the Lord our strength. We want to make sure and promote that in every way we can: in how we pray with them; how we pray for them; how we present the Word to them; and how we guide them not just to do things, but to do things for the glory of God; to motivate them to rejoice and to trust in who God is and what He does.\\n5. Finally, Tom was refreshed by friendships he had in the church.\\nEventually, she did initiate a divorce. Tom has full custody of the children. She didn’t just abandon Tom; she abandoned her children. We’re concerned for the kids—how we help Tom answer some of their questions because they’re pretty young, and as they grow up to help them understand\\xa0God’s love for them and understand the horrible effects of sin. They still see her.\\nChurch leadership goes before the church. We complete the fourth step of Matthew 18, and we saw these men in particular praying for Tom and his ex-wife. We don’t want to lose Tom. She’s gone. She’s out. It’s just amazing to watch our church family love him, to love his children, to make extra efforts to stay involved in his life through fellowship, men studies, counseling, and caring for the kids.\\xa0\\nA year and a half later Tom was still studying sermons from 1 John. How helpful that is. He listens to Scripture audio. He is still tempted to anger at times, but Tom said that it’s not nearly as often and not for as long, and it’s a lot easier to get in check. Praise the Lord that we can see the work of the Spirit in his life.\\nTom looked at me and said: “I’ve been pruned, and I have an overwhelming joy in God. Tim, I can honestly count it as joy because I recognize she is still in her trial.” He feels pity and sorrow for her. He has shed tears of gratitude. He did at the table. We both did over what the Lord has done for him. Not just the pain that he’s endured from his ex-wife, but over what God has done.\\xa0\\nLet me give you this information about Tom’s background. I didn’t learn this until recently. His father was a womanizing drunkard, very apathetic. He left their family when Tom was very young. Four children and a wife left in poverty. Kids were 1, 3, 10, and 14. Tom was 10 when his dad left. And before I learned that, Tom told me, “Tim, I haven’t had a hard life. I have God’s love and goodness.”\\nWhat a perspective. Would you lead out with that? That’s the power of the gospel and God’s grace to transform our hearts.\\nFaithfulness in these matters, friends, is filled with tears and pain, but it’s still faithfulness. We can be confident that our labor is not in vain in the Lord. When we step back, we can see those impacted by the trial are much broader than our counselees.\\xa0\\nOur elders received a letter from Tom’s sister. I’ve taken out identifying names and made substitutes, but I want to share this with you. I’ve never met her; we’ve never met her. She lives on the other side of the country from Huntsville, Alabama. She wrote this to us. I will end with this.\\n“I’ve wanted to send this email for months and I don’t really know where to begin.\\xa0\\nI want to say thank you to the pastors and elders. Thank you for loving my brother and his kids as they have gone through such a difficult time. Thank you for coming alongside my brother and not letting go. Thank you for reaching out to him daily when he went through some horribly dark days. Thank you for all the counseling. Thank you for trying for reconciliation. Thank you for doing everything the Bible lays out for trying to bring repentance in his ex-wife’s life. Thank you for praying. Thank you for letting God use you to be the means of grace in his life. I know God has used you all and your church to answer many of our prayers [she’s speaking of her family’s prayers].\\nI wish I could show you my heart and the appreciation that I have to you all, mainly to God, but to the ways He answered some of our requests. You and your church have glorified God a thousand miles away from me, and I can see it clearly. Such a miracle has been done in my brother’s heart. He’s not bitter or consumed with himself and how he has been wronged. He has clung to Jesus through this. His faith in God through this has changed me. A faith that has been fostered and cared for at your church by God. You are all strangers to me, but you will never know how much your faith and the outpouring of that faith have changed my life and the lives of some people that are very important to me. Thank you doesn’t seem appropriate and wish I could say it more meaningfully. Please keep seeking to glorify God in your church. It’s happening.”\\nThat’s the work of the Lord through us. We don’t always get to see the extended fruits of our labors. What a blessing that is and an encouragement to us.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nConflict\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTim Keeter leads the Music and Counseling ministries at Grace Community Church in Huntsville, AL.

There are exceptions, of course. But they are few and far between. Even when it appears that but one individual is involved, upon further investigation, you will frequently discover that there is a mother or father, a relative or friend—or someone else—who plays an important role in the counseling problem you are considering. Because of this, it is important to understand the basic dynamic that underlies many of the interpersonal difficulties that you will encounter.\\nMore often than not you will find that the husband and wife, parent and child, neighbor and neighbor, church member and church member, will present the principal problem in terms of the issue: “He wants to buy a boat when he knows that we simply can’t afford it!,” “He cheated me in a business deal,” “This kid is incorrigible—she drinks, does drugs and plays around with any stud who comes along.”\\nThe Issue and the Relationship\\nThe issue is always intriguing and tempts a counselor to focus on it at the outset. Usually, it is clearer than the relationship, so it protrudes in the initial description of things. And yet, you will learn that until you have dealt satisfactorily with the relationship, you will not be able to help counselees solve issue problems. In addition to the tempting nature of issue problems, counselees will often pressure you to handle them, sometimes protesting if you turn first to the relationship. In such circumstances, it will be necessary to explain why you are doing so (“You two are in no shape to consider the issue”). I want to suggest, therefore, that in most instances it is fatal to attempt to solve issue problems until relationship problems have been satisfactorily cleared up.\\n“How is that? I’m not sure that I fully get your point. If the husband and wife mentioned above would only come to a conclusion about the boat, the matter would be ended, wouldn’t it?”\\nProbably not. You see, one or the other—or possibly both—would go away from dealing with the issue with sore feelings toward his spouse. That is, if they could even discuss the issue civilly! Their problem has grown to the point that they have come for counseling—evidentially, they failed to solve it on their own. Here is the fundamental problem: most of the time until you have dealt with the relationship, no matter how simple the solution to the problem may be, the parties involved will not handle the issue sensibly (let alone biblically). Once I counseled a couple who, among other things, were fighting over the way each left the toothpaste tube after using it. One squeezed it in the middle (I think that was the husband) and the other left the cap off (I think that was the wife). Now, you would suspect that so simple a problem could be easily dispensed with. But, oh no! Not on your life!\\n“Wait a minute, that’s an easy one to figure out. All they had to do is buy two tubes, and after the first use you’d know whose tube is whose.”\\nVery astute! Indeed, in the end, that’s exactly the way that we solved it. But it didn’t happen as readily as you might suppose. You see, they were in no mood to think rationally. Whenever she went into the bathroom and saw the squashed tube, she said to herself, “That man’s been at it again!” Whenever, he saw the cap removed and found toothpaste hardened at the end of the tube, he thought “Ugh! She doesn’t even care enough for me to put the cap back on. She knows I can’t stand it that way!”\\nNow, surely, you will notice that the problem wasn’t the tube. Both husband and wife were sharp enough to figure out the very solution that you suggested on their own. But if they did so, they probably wouldn’t have needed counseling. The problem wasn’t the toothpaste tube—as I said—it was a marriage so badly on the rocks that the tube had become a symbol of the other interpersonal problems that they had. And, until I was able to bring them into a proper biblical relationship with one another, they wouldn’t even try to seriously deal with the toothpaste tube issue. Having done so, at length, toothpaste tubes were no longer a symbol of larger problems between them, but symbols of those problems—solved.\\nOrdinarily, you will soon discover that you can only deal with an issue after the relationship has been righted biblically, by repentance before God and reconciliation with one another. Click To Tweet\\nSo, don’t be misled into thinking that if you deal with the issue you will have helped your counselee. Ordinarily, you will soon discover that you can only deal with it after the relationship has been righted biblically, by repentance before God and reconciliation with one another. Always ask yourself, “What in the relationship has become a complicating factor?” What is keeping them from solving the issue? In response, you will find yourself confronting sinful attitudes that need changing, instructing counselees in ways of speaking to one another that honor God, unearthing long-standing grudges, clearing up misunderstandings that have led to bitterness, and so on.\\nWhen these have been eliminated and proper biblical ways of relating have been learned (usually over a number of weeks), then all sorts of issues will dissolve as if they had never existed. That is not to say that some may not remain. But when they do, it will be two persons bent on pleasing God who will be resolving them; not two who are hostile, and who, in their self-centeredness, have been ignoring God. So, I urge you to think of each situation in terms of issues and relationships, and you will rarely go wrong.\\n\\nThis blog was originally posted at the Institute for Nouthetic Studies’ blog, view the original post here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nConflict\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJay Adams called pastors back to biblical soul care with the publication of his landmark book Competent to Counsel in 1970.

George is a plastic surgeon who practices in Los Angeles. He was born and raised in Southeast Texas. George graduated from Rice University down in Houston. He attended Harvard Medical School and then completed his general surgery training at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. His plastic surgery residency was done at UCLA and since that time he has been in private practice in LA. While in Boston, that was an important point of your life, Dr. Sanders, where you met, Anna, your wife doing a dietetic internship, and after their marriage, they moved to LA where they’ve enjoyed 43 years of marital bliss. It’s so much fun honestly to watch you two together. I love the relationship that you guys have. Both have been ACBC certified for a number of years and they counsel together, just a joy as well. In their spare time, George and Anna love to serve in the ministry together, as well as travel, entertain and just hang out. They have two adult children who were both believers, both married, and they have two grandsons, which we get to hear about a lot, and I enjoy that. George also serves on the board of directors at The Master’s University and Seminary, longtime members at Grace Community Church in California. Dr. Sanders, it’s a thrill to finally get you on the podcast and let our listeners hear a little bit from you. So, thank you for being with me.\\nNow, as we start this, we’re going to talk about the issue of forgiveness, and here’s what I love about this, I want to preface it this way. I mentioned in the bio that you are a surgeon and the beauty of what we talked about in biblical counseling, is that you can be brilliant in some area of surgery, and it doesn’t mean that your ministry is only dealing with medical issues. The Bible commands us as believers to encourage one another with the Scriptures, and the Scriptures by the power of the Spirit enable us and empowers us to do this type of work. I can’t wait for our discussion today to demonstrate the beauty of God’s Word at work in our life and empowerment for ministry and that sort of thing.\\nSo, I want to start out with talked about this issue of case wisdom in forgiveness and as we talked about forgiveness, forgiveness is sometimes hard to navigate. It’s difficult, sometimes it gets complex with conflict and difficulties. Now, I want to start with this question. Does our sense of justice when we’ve been offended or whatever, is our sense of justice need to be satisfied before we forgive someone?\\nGeorge Sanders: Great question, Dale. Certainly, if you look at God’s forgiveness, there are really two types. There is the judicial forgiveness, which is what we enjoy as believers because of the atoning work of Christ on the cross. That type of forgiveness, judicial forgiveness is accompanied by punishment. But on the other hand, once you are a saved believer, there is parental forgiveness, we continue to sin, and although judicial forgiveness is a one-time event, you need continual cleansing from defilement. This is where parental forgiveness comes in. God is the offended parent and we ask His forgiveness and confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So, that’s the sort of thing that we practice on a daily basis and that’s when the Scripture speaks of praying for forgiveness of our sins, that’s what we’re talking about.\\nThat type of forgiveness by God is not contingent upon punishment. God may chasten us, but He’s not punishing us for our sins. So, certainly, God’s forgiveness when it comes to parental forgiveness does not require punishment as far as the type of forgiveness that we practice as believers. Christ speaks a great deal of this and this forgiveness that He asked us to practice is unconditional. It’s not contingent upon punishment. If you look at the Sermon on the Mount, He spoke of turning the other cheek if someone were to slap you, if you were persecuted for the sake of righteousness, this was a good thing. There did not need to be punishment of the offended party of the other party. It spoke of how when we pray, we are to forgive others just as we’ve been forgiven otherwise you’re not going to enjoy forgiveness. And it’s interesting where the statement is made that we are to forgive from the heart. Peter asked Jesus in Matthew 18 if he should forgive someone seven times, Jesus tells him seventy times seven, and he tells him that he needs to forgive from the heart. The Hebrew word for “heart” is the Greek word for mind, it’s the concept that we need to put on this forgiveness. We need to make it a determination, to forgive someone, a lot like agape love where we decide to love someone, it doesn’t depend upon the person being loved. It just depends on our decision. And also Christ when he was reviled, He did not revile in return,1 Peter 2:23.\\nSo in all those cases, Christ is saying, look, you need to forgive, you need to forgive unconditionally, you are to avoid personal retaliation for an offense against us. We are to be willing to suffer wrong for the sake of Christ. We are to forgive others because God has forgiven us, and we need to do this time and time again in obedience to Christ.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: You mentioned that passage from Ephesians, even Ephesians 4:32, that we are to forgive others in the same way in which God has forgiven us in Christ. And you talk about Christ’s unconditional forgiveness, and I want us to talk about—this is a sticky wicket for a lot of people how do we deal with forgiveness and reconciliation. I want to get to reconciliation later but I want to talk now about forgiveness and some people argue for conditional versus unconditional. You mentioned that Christ definitely, gives certain aspects that are unconditional parameters for forgiveness. But is that always the rule? And then I want to take that a little bit further and just say, are we to forgive unconditionally in every single case?\\xa0\\nGeorge Sanders: Excellent question. Christ, for the most part spoke of unconditional forgiveness, but there were a couple of examples in Scripture. For instance, Luke 17:1-4, where it speaks of someone stumbling a young believer and that it would be better that a millstone to be placed around their neck and they be thrown into the sea, and then He follows that immediate statement that if someone sins and comes to you and repents, we are to forgive them and where to do that seven times. So, the idea is that in certain cases, there is repentance that’s involved and that specifically would be in the antecedent versus those two verses just before in the case of stumbling someone else. So if you are harming someone else, stumbling someone else, Christ is speaking of the need for repentance. \\nAlso Matthew 18, of course, church discipline, if someone sins, it speaks of how you are to go to that person and if they don’t listen to you, to bring a witness, and if they don’t listen then at some point there to be put out of the church. Again in a case like that repentance is built into that. So in those specific cases, Christ spoke of that, and if we sort of look at all of Scripture and sort of put things together, I think they’re basically four instances in which repentance is required.\\nFirst of all, if someone else has been sinned against. You are not in a position to forgive that sin of the person who sinned against them, and Scripture speaks of seeking justice for the oppressed, defending the orphan and the widow, and in a case like that, if another person has been sinned against, we’re not in a position to forgive that sin. Also, when ignoring an offense might hurt the sinner, might hurt the offender, confrontation is required. In Galatians 6:1, it speaks of someone who’s caught in a trespass a spiritually mature individual to restore such one to go to that person, practice restoration counseling, if you will, and again, in a case like that you’re looking for restoration, you’re looking for repentance on that person’s part. So, that would be where the offender is harmed. Also, if there’s potential for the church to be damaged, for instance, the Apostle Paul, speaking of how he had heard that a man was sleeping with his father’s wife, he admonished the Corinthian Church for that and told them that they should put this man out. So, if the church is in a position to be harmed by the sin, repentance is required. And finally, I would say that if there is a broken relationship, repentance is required, again in the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew 5:23 says that if you’re presenting your offering at an altar and remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar and go and be reconciled to your brother, then present your offering. So, again if there is a broken relationship, reconciliation and repentance that goes along with that is required. So those four instances would be things that I think we need to keep in mind.\\nDale Johnson: And that’s really helpful as we think about the parameters that are giving given in Scripture because as I teach my students in the seminary class, you know, not everything fleshes out as nice and neatly as it does in theory, right? And so, when we get into the messiness of real lives, it can be confusing and complex and these are parameters or grids if you will that help us to think with biblical wisdom, or we could call it case wisdom, as we’re talking about on this particular podcast.\\nNow, as we talk about unconditional conditional forgiveness, people bat that back and forth in a lot of different ways. And forgiveness is certainly one thing. Now, I want to bring up the issue of reconciliation, sometimes people conflate those two things and they’re not one and the same. So, I want you to help us now if we can think through reconciliation. So, what are some of the steps that a person needs to take in order to achieve biblical reconciliation?\\nGeorge Sanders: If you’re thinking about the word “forgive” basically in the Greek, it means letting go of an obligation that a person has towards you. On the other hand, reconciliation is about the restoration of a broken relationship. The Greek word speaks of a change, a change in the relationship between the two parties from one of enmity to one of peace. So, if you have, for instance, the life of Joseph where his brothers had sold him into slavery in Egypt, and then through a matter of God’s providence, he found himself as prime minister, and then his brothers come to him. They don’t know who he is, but he knows very well who they are they’re looking to buy grain because they’re starving and Joseph puts them through reconciliation. He first forces them to face up to what they had done—imprisoning a brother, and then sending the rest back, and demanding that Benjamin to be brought forth. He forced them to face up to what they had done, and they were speaking between themselves, not knowing that he understood every word, and they were facing up to it.\\nAnd then, forsaken, the second F, forsaken, how does he do that? Well, he brings them all together, he sits them at a table in order of age, and of course, they were astonished by that, and then he gives Benjamin five times the portion than he had given anyone else. Now, when he was with them years and years and years before, and his father had shown favoritism toward him, what did they do? Well, they threw him in the pit, then they sold him off. In this case, the brothers said nothing. So, he saw yes, they generally had not only faced their sin, but they had forsaken it. And in that case he then completed this with the third F, which would be forgiveness, always forgiving, as he said to them, particularly when their father Jacob had died and they were fearful that he would do away with them. Now that their father is no longer there to tell him to back off. He said, hey guys, you know, all is forgiven. You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good and he’s allowed me to save the family. So again, those 3 f’s in that, that is how Joseph managed reconciliation.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, and that’s a great narrative I think to demonstrate just very practically his faith and belief in God, and then that being empowering for him to reconcile, to forgive. Now, we talked about as I mentioned in the previous question, forgiveness, and reconciliation. And I want you to help us to distinguish between the two. It certainly seems to me that in order to reconcile, forgiveness is absolutely necessary. But unfortunately, there are some times where forgiveness can be offered or even granted to some degree, but reconciliation has not happened, so, help us to understand what is the difference between forgiveness and reconciliation. \\nGeorge Sanders: I’ll give you an example in my own personal life. I had a nurse who worked for me and I know there’s also another doctor’s office where another nurse was the head of the OR. Essentially hired her away from us, and that nurse who did that had actually worked for me as well. So there she was really doing me dirty, if you will, so, my response to that was to forgive her unconditionally. This was a personal offense, it didn’t fit into one of those four categories. Well, three categories, so I forgave her, but yet, there was still a fractured relationship. And so I went to her, I approached her and I told her how I felt about it and she didn’t agree. She said no, that was just the way business was done. So to this day, we’re not reconciled, but forgiveness has occurred. So I think that our attitude should be one of forgiveness and we are to seek reconciliation, but that’s not always possible. If the two parties can simply not agree on something and if you’re one of those parties in your and you’ve examined things from a Scriptural perspective, and Scripture’s clearly on your side, then I think you just have to let it be. You can treat them as though the sin had not occurred. But on the other hand, the relationship has not been repaired and that’s what reconciliation is.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Well, that really helps us to see this in 3D, right? Where we can see the expressions of forgiveness and reconciliation. And I think that’s helpful as the Scripture talks about seek peace as far as it depends on you, you can’t force a person to reconcile and to regain that trust. So, that’s a helpful distinction, but we offer forgiveness in that way so that we’re not in bondage to bitterness and anger and wrath, and so on that can build up if we harbor unforgiveness toward a person. \\nDr. Sanders, this has been outstanding and very, very helpful in thinking through and really bringing practical reality to how we deal with issues of forgiveness that can get really complex through a very case-wise grid. So, brother, thank you so much for this.\\n\\nHelpful Resources:\\nClick here for more information about ACBC’s 2023 Annual Conference.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

Many of you are familiar with Dr. Scott. He teaches in the graduate program of biblical counseling at The Master’s University in Santa Clarita, California. He has over 40 years of experience in counseling and pastoral ministry, and he happens to work here at ACBC on staff as well as our Membership Director. He’s a fellow with ACBC as well. Stuart’s an author and he’s married to his wife, Zondra. They have two grown children and two grandchildren. Dr. Scott, as we talk about this issue of transactional forgiveness, I’m so grateful that you’re here to chat with us about it. It’s so fun that you and I get to chat on a weekly basis most of the time, and it’s so good to just enjoy time sitting down with you. I love moments like this where those folks who are listening out there get to listen in on conversations that we have quite frequently, and this week is no different as we talk about this issue of transactional forgiveness. So, welcome to the podcast. I want to ask you a few questions about it.\\xa0\\nStuart Scott: Thank you, Dale. It’s great to be here.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now, as we start, some people may say, okay, why are you qualifying this issue of forgiveness? Of course, we’re all called to forgive. So I want you to start in this place, Stuart, if you can, what is the difference between unconditional forgiveness and what we’re describing here as transactional forgiveness?\\nStuart Scott: You know, when I’m thinking through this whole topic of forgiveness, there are numerous books written on the topic, all taking different positions, but unconditional forgiveness typically means that you have a love for an individual and you just don’t want to have to talk to them about a clear offense that they did, because forgiveness is dealing with sin issues. It’s not dealing with conscience issues and wisdom issues, preference issues, or difference issues. It’s dealing with a clear offense from Scripture, where they have broken God’s law against someone else. The unconditional is just, let it go and move on, and maybe ignore it or overlook it and cover it. It feels really good to do. You feel good about it. It’s very therapeutic, but it doesn’t resolve the offense that took place.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, and the goal, when we think about things like forgiveness, is certainly reconciliation. Some people may hear you describe some of those and think, I don’t really know that I understand the distinction. Maybe a good place to start would be for us to talk about the positives of transactional forgiveness or even the negatives of unconditional forgiveness. Maybe let’s start with some of the objections to transactional forgiveness. What are some of the problems that people see with this issue of transactional forgiveness?\\xa0\\nStuart Scott: Well, when we see the transactional, it just means you go to the person to talk about the offense, and if the person listens and hears and responds, you forgive them. So there’s a transaction and reconciliation there. As Matthew 18 says, as Luke 17 says, “Pay attention to yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times in the day, and turns to you seven times, saying, ‘I repent,’ you must forgive him.” So we see the transaction there in the same way that God does with us. We’re at odds with Him. We’re hostile. We’re unreconciled and we repent and believe in the Lord. He graces us with that and He forgives us. \\nIf you have just unconditional forgiveness, you would probably land in universalism, where everyone would be forgiven by God and no one would go to hell. So you’ve got a whole line of thinking that gets in trouble theologically, but the verse that typically is used as one of the main objections is Mark 11. I’m just going to turn there because this is the one verse that they continually go to, those who believe in unconditional forgiveness. It says, in Mark 11:25, “And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.” Well, that does sound like you’re all alone with God and you just drop it. You forgive it. Forgive your brother or sister, whatever that might be, and you’re done. That objection, and that verse, particularly, is an imperative that you keep doing. You keep forgiving when you stand praying. Keep on forgiving. It’s the present active there. When you take one verse and you build a whole theology on it, you can get really into trouble. It sounds like the Holy Spirit is contradicting himself in the Bible. One verse says, you go to your brother and deal with it. This one, well you stand there, pray, and forgive. But if you build a theology on one verse, I would say, go to the verse before and you’ll have trouble with that one too, which says, “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.” So the prosperity gospel—I mean, they just latch on to that verse. We know what the rest of the Scripture says. If you ask according to God’s will, He hears you. \\nSo you have to take all of God’s Word, almost in a systematic approach. You have to bring all of what God says and then fit it together, which could mean that you’ve already dealt with the issue. When you’re praying for your brother, it kind of comes back about what they did to you, and you just have to keep forgiving. I mean, I would look at how all the Scripture fits together rather than its teaching something very different.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: That’s good. Let’s talk about how to navigate that, because, you know, in counseling we see issues like this quite frequently. You know, conflict comes up, and man, we’re not sure how to navigate the difficulties of this conflict. It becomes very complex very quickly. We know forgiveness is a part of that, so let’s talk. How do we start to help people understand this issue of forgiveness? There seems to be sort of a maze that we navigate. You know, honestly, when people ask me questions like this, I’ll often respond in a couple of ways. I typically will give my position on something and then I will explain to them sort of the landscape so that they understand, biblically, this is how arguments are made for and against where I stand, and this is how arguments are made for and against where other people might stand. So what I want you to do Stuart, is to help us to navigate what seems to be a difficult maze here, relative to the issue of forgiveness.\\xa0\\nStuart Scott: Yeah, I think understanding key doctrines—sin. What sin is. It’s a breach. It’s anti-relational. It separates. If you don’t understand that, that’s going to just have a snowball effect and it just picks up speed and we get into all kinds of trouble then. So we have to understand sin, that there is a breach and separation, and it needs to be dealt with, confessed, and asked for forgiveness. 1 John 1:9—we also see it in Proverbs 28:13—if you cover your sin, you won’t prosper, but if you confess and forsake it, you’ll find mercy. So, understanding sin and what confession and repentance means—confess to God. You confess to the person you have sinned against. What reconciliation means—it’s bringing two people together and the offense has been dealt with, that sin that occurred. That’s really true love. People think if you love, you won’t deal with it, but Proverbs 27:5-6 says open admonishment is better than love carefully concealed and faithful are the wounds of a friend, better than the kisses of an enemy. Then the covering—people think, well, I’ll just cover it and hide it. Well, that’s truly taught in Scripture. I mean, that is a principle in Scripture, but it seems to come after the transaction has happened. Atonement—It was hid after sins were atoned for. David said, when he confessed his sin and he repented, then his sin was forgiven and it was covered. So, I think we move things around to make it easy on us, which is a real problem. The therapeutic unconditional is more about us. It’s not loving your brother or sister, and it’s not really thinking of God’s glory, and how to remedy something for His glory.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Well, and that the sin is dealt with, right? Jesus doesn’t just, you know, set our sin aside as if it didn’t happen. He paid for it on the cross in the same way that repentance or seeking forgiveness helps to deal with that sin as well. As you think about this, what I can hear is you’re navigating in your mind how you’re putting the Scripture together theologically, and technically we call that systematic theology. So I want you to talk through that just for a minute. How does systematic theology help us to understand that a transaction in forgiveness is necessary?\\nStuart Scott: When you look at systemic, it helps to bring all of the Scriptures together on the teaching of sin—Hamartiology. It will teach all of things about salvation—what’s needed to be saved by repentance and faith in Christ—and then how to be sanctified and grow. \\nSo, when you’re looking at all the passages, that’s what I usually find is missing, it’s all of the passages. They’ll take one verse where Jesus prayed from the cross, you know, His prayer to the Father, “Forgive them.” It seems like it’s unconditional, but it was a prayer request. It wasn’t a pronouncement. He wasn’t just forgiving them. He was praying that they would be forgiven, and 50 days later at Pentecost, many of them were forgiven because they repented. Peter preached to them and said, you must repent. Later on, there were other messages where some of the religious leaders were there and they repented. So that sin was forgiven of crucifying the Son of God. So I think looking at the Matthew 18 passage, if we just unconditionally forgive, why would you ever have church discipline? You wouldn’t. You’d just let things go like it was going on in Corinth, and sin gets in and leaven gets in and then the church is impure and it has factious people. Sin, undealt with, contaminates.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Alright, I want to give some pushback. When you describe all of that, sometimes I think what is heard is that we’re leaving out issues of the heart, the attitude toward forgiveness. Well, if you’re talking about transaction in forgiveness, then we’re not talking about heart attitude. Are we responsible in that way? So help to navigate that. Do we help to teach that someone needs to have a heart posture toward forgiveness? I think the Bible certainly indicates that, but help us navigate that and how that works, the heart attitude along with a transaction of forgiveness.\\xa0\\nStuart Scott: Yeah, that’s a great question, because our heart attitude is so important, not only the transaction but the heart attitude behind it. The Bible teaches to forgive as God has forgiven us, full of grace, quickly, and repeatedly. As a matter of fact, we are to be like our Heavenly Father and pursue forgiveness. We’re going after people because we love them. We want this sin, this breach, to be remedied so that we can be in fellowship and restoration. I think what we have come to at ACBC is, we need to have a forgiving spirit. He who was forgiven much loves much. Since we have been forgiven so much by God, we have that posture of, absolutely, we’re willing to forgive. Absolutely, we want it because of what God has done for us and so we seek it. We seek the good of the other person. We seek God’s glory, and in our heart we don’t get bitter because we’re actively loving our brother or sister and going after them. Romans 12:18 says, as much as possible, as depends on you, live at peace with all men. Sometimes the person won’t respond, but you just keep loving them, keep praying for him, and then your heart is just free from bitterness.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I think that’s really helpful, Stuart. In the short time that we’ve had today, it’s hard for us to navigate all of the ins and outs, but I’m sure this has peaked folks’ interest. Maybe they didn’t even understand that there was a distinction, Scripturally, as we think about forgiveness in this way. In order to understand how to implement something, you have to have knowledge of the Scripture in it. So as we think about encouraging people to think further, what are some of the books that you would recommend for them to read, to engage in, to learn more about this issue of forgiveness, and in learning more about the Scripture, how they can implement it better?\\xa0\\nStuart Scott: Yeah, I think the first one I read that helped solve some seemingly contradictions from Scripture was Jay Adams’ book, From Forgiven to Forgiving. It has been some years ago, but it was helpful in thinking through some of the big issues like Jesus’ forgiveness from the cross, Stephen, who prayed that the sin would be laid at their feet, kind of at their account, and then the Lord answers the prayer and you have the salvation of Paul. Chris Brauns’ book, Unpacking Forgiveness—He compares the therapeutic, feel good, just forgive everybody and not really deal with the sin, versus, from the heart out, forgive like Christ, deal with the sin for the glory of God. I have really appreciated Chris Brauns’ book, Unpacking Forgiveness.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I would encourage those of you who have not read either of the books that Stuart mentioned and you’re looking for CEUs, this would be a great way for you to accomplish some of this work, diving into some of these books and studying this a little bit deeper. Stuart, this has been really helpful, brother. I appreciate you spending time with us, thinking through this. If you’re counseling, listen, you’re going to deal with this issue a thousand times over. So, you need to understand clearly how you think about this through the Scriptures in order to encourage people to seek proper reconciliation and forgiveness.\\n\\nHelpful Resources\\nUnpacking Forgiveness: Biblical Answers for Complex Questions and Deep Wounds by Chris Brauns\\nFrom Forgiven to Forgiving: Learning to Forgive One Another God’s Way by Jay Adams\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'Do I Need to Forgive Myself?', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Kim Shadday', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Forgiveness 12', 'question': 'It is not by the works of the believer that their sins are forgiven, it is through the blood of Christ.', 'body': 'Do you have regrets from your past – something you said or did that you wish you could change? Do you have an incident of failure or sin that you would like to erase from your memory? A situation where you caused harm or hurt to others? Although the past cannot be changed, your hope is in a God who gave His only Son, Jesus Christ to take your sin away forever. He died on the cross to wipe your slate clean and make you righteous (2 Corinthians 5:21).\\xa0\\nMany counselees believe that God has forgiven past transgressions, but they haven’t forgiven (or “can’t forgive”) themselves. As\\xa0counselors, we must confront this unrighteous thinking that they must forgive themselves since it hinders counselees from experiencing the forgiveness and cleansing that God has promised. \\xa0\\nHere are a few manifestations of false theology in regard to forgiveness:\\xa0\\n1.Guilt and Shame – Guilt is the result of not yielding to the Holy Spirit’s conviction of sin. Guilt can become so intense even for believers, that counselees no longer believe they have merely done something wrong, but rather that they have jeopardized their status before God. The devil wants to bring shame upon people; therefore, he repeatedly screams lies into their minds—they are losers, failures, disappointments—in order to deter them from focusing on God’s truth—they are chosen, redeemed, forgiven, and loved (Ephesians 1:4-6).\\xa0\\n2. Doubt – Even after confession of sins, counselees may not feel the burden of guilt lifted, deceiving them into thinking that they are not fully forgiven. Doubts emerge when feelings are not congruent with Truth. The Bible, our source of absolute Truth, tells us to trust the Lord—not our feelings (Jeremiah 17:9-10).\\xa0\\n3. Pride – Despite confession of sins, believing the sincerity of God’s forgiveness can be difficult. Some may not accept the simplicity of putting their trust in God in order to be saved. They may either embrace an unbiblical works-based system by trying to be “good” in order to receive God’s favor, and/or they may offer a penance of self-atonement in exchange for complete forgiveness. They must be careful not to exalt their own knowledge and judgment above God’s wisdom and sovereign rule (2 Corinthians 10:5).\\xa0\\n4. Hindered Salvation – If counselees will not forgive themselves for their own sins due to guilt and shame then they may also reason that God is unable to forgive them. This makes salvation seem impossible. Emotions will insist that counselees are unlovable, and doubt will deem them unusable. All of these elements can either cause them to wonder if they have lost their salvation, or to doubt if they were ever saved at all. But the Bible teaches that a born-again believer’s sin is forgiven and will not be held against them (Psalm 103:1-2, 8-11). Scripture further confirms that nothing can separate them from their heavenly Father (John 10:28).\\xa0\\nA few biblical concepts of forgiveness will help dispel the lie that we need to forgive ourselves.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll sin is against God. All transgression is committed against a holy God (Romans 3:23, Psalm 51:4). Sin hurts others and causes pain and suffering to oneself. But all iniquity is a violation of God’s law. Sin breaks fellowship with God, and that primary relationship needs to be made right before any other relationship can be reconciled (Isaiah 59:1-2; Psalm 32:1-5). After that, counselees may need to seek forgiveness from those who have been offended and hurt by their sin.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0God’s grace is not just for salvation. Salvation is by God’s grace (Ephesians 2:8), and so is walking by faith and living a life of obedience to the Savior (Psalm 84:11). The grace that God extends through forgiveness is the same grace necessary to forgive others. One must first be a recipient of God’s forgiveness in order to grant forgiveness.\\xa0\\nGod’s forgiveness is relational. God loved each person first, and that is why He sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for the sins of the world (John 3:16). God’s love is everlasting, and nothing can separate believers from His love (Romans 8:35-39). Asking for forgiveness of sins is not an impersonal business transaction, but rather an intimate act of love, mercy, and grace which God extends to His own. Insisting on “forgiving oneself” for sin tarnishes the personal nature of each man’s relationship with the Lord.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen a counselee is trying desperately to forgive himself, it is sometimes because he wants to remove those powerful, uncomfortable feelings of remorse and regret. His sins do hurt those around him, and the consequences can be unpleasant and difficult to handle. But the answer is not found in a prideful desire to remove the feelings and consequences by learning to forgive oneself; it is by following the principles God has clearly communicated in His Word.\\xa0\\xa0\\n1. Humble yourself. – in humility, receive God’s grace (James 4:6).\\xa0\\n2. Confess your sin to God and repent. – Confession means to agree with the charges brought against you. Repentance is to turn away from sin unto God. Ask God to reveal sin—present and past—and then acknowledge that sin and be specific (Psalm 51:3).\\xa0\\n3. Ask others for forgiveness. – Lingering guilt after the confession of sin to God could be an indication of a need to seek forgiveness from others. (Matthew 5:23-24).\\xa0\\n4. Trust in God’s Word. – Being forgiven is not a feeling; it is a choice to believe that God’s inerrant Word is true and trustworthy. If He says you are forgiven, then you are forgiven (1 John 1:9).\\xa0\\n5. Make changes and move forward. – Guilt will continue if there is no fruit of repentance of one’s sin. God’s Word gives instruction on how to make these changes by confessing and forsaking one’s old ways, changing one’s perspective to conform to God’s ways, and then building new godly habits and behaviors (Romans 12:5; Ephesians 4:22-24).\\xa0\\n6. Guard your heart. – Watch for the enemy’s attacks. Satan’s schemes distract and deter Christians from serving the Lord. Jesus warned His disciples to watch and pray (Mark 26:41). Satan is a relentless deceiver, tempter, and accuser (1 Peter 5:8).\\xa0\\n7. Discipline your thoughts. – Do not dwell on past sin. Shame and regret are rooted in “if only” thinking. Pivot your thinking back to the truth of God as revealed in Scripture. Paul admonishes the saints to not look back, but rather to move forward in spiritual growth (Philippians 3:13-14), and then keep the peaceful spirit that God freely gives by laying burdens down in prayer and by disciplining thoughts. (Philippians 4:6-8).\\xa0\\n8. Walk in God’s Grace. – Live according to the abundant grace God has provided. His grace is what enables trust and obedience to His Word. He has given you all that you need. (2 Corinthians 9:8; 2 Peter 1:3).\\xa0\\nA secular model of counseling will support and promote the concept of “forgiving yourself,” but God’s Word does not. This harmful thinking displaces God as Judge and ultimately negates the purpose of the cross. It is not by the works of the believer that their sins are forgiven, it is through the blood of Christ. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace; (Ephesians 1:7) \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKim Shadday is a certified biblical counselor of women and young ladies in Indianapolis, Indiana.

      "{'title': 'The Call to Forgive', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Joshua Greiner', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Forgiveness 12', 'question': 'Forgiveness is more than just words that are exchanged between people when sin has been committed.', 'body': 'We are all familiar with Peter’s question of how often he should forgive his brother and Christ’s response, “not seven times, but seventy times seven” (Matthew 18:22). One question that naturally arises, not only from the disciples but also to the modern ear, is,\\xa0“How is this possible?\\xa0How can I truly forgive someone that many times?”\\nThe answer may be in that forgiveness is first and foremost a decision of the will. It is true that forgiveness will be an act of the whole person (our thoughts, desires, and volition), but it may be helpful for us to start with our will. The choice that we make as persons who have been wronged and slighted comes from deep convictions about our own sinfulness, about God’s mercy and grace toward us, and a belief that we should want to extend that mercy to as many as we can (see the following metaphor of what the Kingdom is like after Christ’s correction of Peter). But as I said, forgiveness is, first and foremost, an act of the will and it involves the person granting forgiveness making four commitments to the person seeking forgiveness (even when some or all our emotions may not be where they should be).\\nCommitment #1: A Decision Not to Dwell on the Sin, But to Dwell on Christ\\nThis can be one of the hardest promises to make when granting forgiveness because so much of this can start at the involuntary level. A person who has been sinned against may at times recall the offense while doing mundane things in life and feel as if they have no control over this recollection. While that is true, you may have little control over recalling the sin, you do have a choice of dwelling on that sin. Either you can choose to dwell on the sin that was done against you, how much you were hurt, and so on, or you can choose to dwell on the things that Christ calls you to dwell on (Ephesians 4:22-24). You can choose to dwell on “…whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise…” (Philippians 4:8).\\nThis is hard and will require work on your part. You will need to prepare for the battle because the Armor of God works best when it is already on and you have trained yourself for battle (Ephesians 6:11ff). This might include you drafting a list of things to dwell on instead of the evil that was done against you. This list could include the gospel indicatives that were accomplished for you by Christ. It might include just choosing to worship God in the moment instead of dwelling on your situation (we see David do this all the time). The point is, not only is the first promise of forgiveness a decision not to dwell on the sin that was done, but it is also a choice to dwell on other things as you put on the new man.\\nCommitment #2: A Decision Not to Gossip, But to Speak Well of Others\\nWhen we are sinned against, one of the first desires we might have is to get revenge for ourselves. That revenge can come in all sorts of modes that are not pleasing to Christ, and one of them is particularly susceptible when it comes to Christians: gossip. Proverbs describes the words of a gossiper as “choice morsel” (Proverbs 18:8) and anyone who has sinned by listening to gossip knows that to be true. It can be easy in the household of God to “seek wisdom” or “pray for a situation” when in reality it is nothing more than gossip. When a person chooses to forgive someone, they are promising not to gossip about the issue. This means they are going to be done talking about the problem unless there is some part of it that needs to be solved, and only then are they talking to people who are involved in that problem.\\nInstead of gossiping when we are sinned against, we need to choose to speak well of others. That doesn’t mean we need to make up lies to make them sound better than they are, but it does mean we will only present to others that which is good (and no, you can’t say that there is nothing good about\\xa0this\\xa0person). The command from Paul is, “Let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth, but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment, so that it will give grace to those who hear” (Ephesians 4:29). So, anyone who hears you talk about the person who sinned against you needs to be benefited by it.\\nCommitment #3: A Decision Not to Bring It Up for Their Hurt, But to Restore\\nMany times when people think about forgiveness, they think they are never allowed to bring up what happened. Rather, Scripture encourages us to choose not to use the past as a weapon or a tool to hurt someone. Meaning, let’s say a husband has asked his wife’s forgiveness for an outburst of anger against her. She granted forgiveness to him. \\xa0But, later, if they have an argument about something, she can’t bring up that past as a tool to hurt him in the fight, saying something like, “Oh yeah, well at least I don’t get angry like you get angry.” That would be a violation of what it means to grant forgiveness.\\nHowever, let’s say she is trying to care for her husband and love him the way Christ calls her to, she could point out a pattern of anger when he speaks by saying, “Honey, do you notice that when you speak with me, you can present a heart of anger? You did it last night, and you are doing it again tonight.” Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetfulness; it means choosing to not bring it up to hurt them. When the past is brought up, it is to be used as a tool for restoration and repentance (Galatians 6:1). There may be all sorts of reasons that a person may need to bring up the past, but the goal is always the same: help that person become like Christ. Help restore them in their walk with God.\\nCommitment #4: A Decision Not to Allow This to Ruin the Relationship, But to Look for Opportunities to Love\\nLastly, with forgiveness, one must choose not to allow the relationship to be ruined by sin. There must be a place for reconciliation between the two people. That being said, when choosing to forgive a person, it is not required to\\xa0trust\\xa0them to the same degree that they once did, or that every aspect of the relationship must be fully restored in this moment to the way it was. There could be significant consequences to a sin that last an entire lifetime, and a person that is truly repentant will be ok with that. They will not fight consequences but see them as a natural part of how God has ordered this world for His glory.\\nLaying aside the most serious cases for a moment, the call to love your enemy is all over the pages of the Bible. When you have been hurt by someone, consider what really displays Christ, what really brings God glory. Is it repaying evil or cutting off that relationship, or is it your choosing to love your enemy since God chose to love His enemy? Is it never talking to that person again, or is it seeking their welfare? A choice to love those who have hurt you is one of the best ways to glorify God. That might mean it takes some time at first for you to desire to express that kind of love that God calls us to, but the call is still there. You might need to plan on how to show that love just like you have had to plan other things mentioned above.\\nForgiveness is more than just words that are exchanged between people when sin has been committed, it is a choice of the entire person who has been wronged. That choice, while hard, glorifies God.\\n\\nThis blog was originally posted at Counseling with Confidence and Compassion,\\xa0view the original post here.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoshua Greiner is an ACBC-certified counselor and Fellow.

      "{'title': 'El llamado a perdonar', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Joshua Greiner', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Forgiveness 12', 'question': 'El perdón es más que solo palabras que se intercambian entre las personas cuando se ha cometido pecado.', 'body': 'Todos estamos familiarizados con la pregunta de Pedro sobre la frecuencia con la que debe perdonar a su hermano y a la respuesta de Cristo, “no siete veces,\\xa0sino hasta setenta veces siete” (Mateo 18:22). Una pregunta que surge naturalmente, no solo de los discípulos, sino también del oído moderno, es: “¿Cómo es posible esto? ¿Cómo puedo perdonar realmente a alguien tantas veces?”\\nLa respuesta puede estar en que el perdón es ante todo una decisión de la voluntad. Es cierto que el perdón es un acto que involucra a toda la persona (nuestros pensamientos, deseos y voluntad), pero puede ser útil para nosotros comenzar con nuestra voluntad. La elección que tomamos como personas que han sido agraviadas y menospreciadas proviene de profundas convicciones acerca de nuestra propia pecaminosidad, de la misericordia y gracia de Dios hacia nosotros, y de la creencia de que debemos querer extender esa misericordia a tantos como podamos (véase la siguiente metáfora de cómo es el Reino después de la corrección de Pedro por Cristo). Pero como dije, el perdón es, ante todo, un acto de voluntad e implica que la persona que concede el perdón haga cuatro compromisos con la persona que busca el perdón (incluso cuando algunas o todas nuestras emociones pueden no estar donde deberían estar).\\nCompromiso #1: La decisión de no pensar/morar en el pecado, sino de morar en Cristo\\nEsta puede ser una de las promesas más difíciles de hacer al conceder el perdón porque mucho de esto puede comenzar a un nivel involuntario. Una persona contra la que han pecado puede por veces recordar la ofensa mientras hace cosas mundanas en la vida y sentir como si no tuviera control sobre este recuerdo. Si bien eso es cierto, es posible que tenga poco control sobre recordar el pecado, pero tiene la opción de decidir morar en ese pecado. Puede elegir morar en el pecado que se hizo contra usted, cuánto fue lastimado, etc., o puede elegir morar en las cosas en las que Cristo le llama a pensar (Efesios 4:22-24). Usted puede optar por pensar en “…\\xa0todo lo que es verdadero, todo lo digno, todo lo justo, todo lo puro, todo lo amable, todo lo honorable, si hay alguna virtud o algo que merece elogio, en esto meditad.” (Filipenses 4:8).\\nEsto es difícil y requerirá trabajo de su parte. Tendrá que prepararse para la batalla porque la armadura de Dios funciona mejor cuando ya está puesta y cuando ha estado entrenando para la batalla (Efesios 6:11). Esto podría incluir la elaboración de una lista de cosas en las que detenerse a pensar en lugar del mal que se hizo en su contra. Esta lista podría incluir los indicativos del Evangelio, en lo\\xa0que Dios\\xa0ya hizo a su favor en Cristo. Podría incluir simplemente la elección de adorar a Dios en el momento en lugar de detenerse en su situación (vemos a David hacer esto todo el tiempo). El punto es que la primera promesa del perdón no solo es la decisión de no morar en el pecado que fue hecho, sino que también es una opción para pensar y morar en otras cosas mientras se reviste del nuevo hombre.\\nCompromiso #2: La decisión de no chismear, sino de hablar bien de los demás\\nCuando pecan contra nosotros, uno de los primeros deseos que podríamos tener es de vengarnos. Esa venganza puede venir en todo tipo de modos que no son agradables a Cristo, y uno de ellos es particularmente susceptible cuando se trata de cristianos: el chisme. Proverbios describe las palabras de un chismoso como “bocados deliciosos” (Proverbios 18:8) y cualquiera que haya pecado escuchando chismes sabe que eso es cierto. Puede ser fácil en la casa de Dios “buscar sabiduría” o “orar por una situación” cuando en realidad no es más que chismear. Cuando una persona decide perdonar a alguien, está prometiendo no chismear sobre el asunto. Esto significa que van a dejar de hablar sobre el problema a menos que haya alguna parte del mismo que necesite ser resuelta, y solo entonces se busca hablar con las personas que están involucradas en ese problema.\\nEn lugar de chismear cuando pecan en contra nuestra, tenemos que elegir hablar bien de los demás. Eso no significa que necesitemos inventar mentiras para hacerlas sonar mejor de lo que son, significa que solo presentaremos a los demás lo que es bueno (y no, no puede decir que no hay nada bueno en esa persona). El mandamiento de Pablo es: “No salga de vuestra boca ninguna palabra mala, sino solo la que sea buena para edificación, según la necesidad\\xa0del momento, para que imparta gracia a los que escuchan” (Efesios 4:29). Por lo tanto, cualquiera que le oiga hablar de la persona que pecó contra usted tiene que ser beneficiado por ello.\\nCompromiso #3: La decisión de no sacar el tema para dañar, sino para restaurar.\\xa0\\xa0.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMuchas veces, cuando la gente piensa sobre el perdón, piensan que no les es permitido mencionar lo que sucedió. Más bien, la Escritura nos alienta a elegir no usar el pasado como arma o herramienta para herir a alguien. Es decir, Es decir, digamos que un marido ha pedido perdón a su mujer por un arrebato de ira contra ella. Ella le concedió el perdón. Pero, más tarde, si tienen una discusión por algo, ella no puede sacar a relucir ese pasado como herramienta para herirlo en la pelea, diciendo algo así como: “Ah, sí, bueno, al menos yo no me enfado como tú”. Eso sería una violación de lo que significa conceder el perdón.\\nSin embargo, digamos que ella está tratando de cuidar a su esposo y amarlo de la manera que Cristo la llama a hacerlo, ella podría señalar un patrón de enojo cuando él habla diciendo: “Cariño, ¿notas que cuando hablas conmigo, puedes presentar un corazón enojado? Lo hiciste anoche, y lo estás haciendo de nuevo esta noche”. El perdón no significa olvido; significa elegir no sacar el tema para hacer daño. Cuando se menciona el pasado, se debe utilizar como herramienta para la restauración y arrepentimiento (Gálatas 6:1). Puede haber todo tipo de razones por las que una persona pueda necesitar mencionar el pasado, pero el objetivo es siempre el mismo: ayudar a esa persona a ser como Cristo. Ayudar a restaurar su camino con Dios.\\nCompromiso #4: La decisión de no permitir que esto arruine la relación, sino de buscar oportunidades para amar.\\xa0\\xa0\\nPor último, con el perdón, uno debe elegir no permitir que la relación se arruine por el pecado. Debe haber un lugar para la reconciliación entre las dos personas. Dicho esto, al elegir perdonar a una persona, no se requiere confiar en ella en el mismo grado que antes, o que cada aspecto de la relación debe ser completamente restaurado en este momento a la forma en que era. Podría haber consecuencias significativas para un pecado que duró toda una vida, y una persona que está verdaderamente arrepentida estará de acuerdo con eso. No luchará contra las consecuencias, sino que las verá como una parte natural de cómo Dios ha ordenado este mundo para su gloria.\\nDejando a un lado los casos más graves por un momento, el llamado a amar a su enemigo está en todas las páginas de la Biblia. Cuando alguien le haya lastimado, considere lo que realmente muestra a Cristo, lo que realmente trae gloria a Dios. ¿Es devolver el mal o cortar esa relación, o es su elección de amar a su enemigo ya que Dios eligió amar a su enemigo? ¿Es no volver a hablar con esa persona, o es buscar su bienestar? La elección de amar a los que le han lastimado es una de las mejores maneras de glorificar a Dios. Eso puede significar que al principio le lleve algún tiempo desear expresar ese tipo de amor al que Dios nos llama, pero el llamado sigue ahí. Es posible que necesite planificar cómo mostrar ese amor al igual que ha tenido que planificar otras cosas mencionadas anteriormente.\\nEl perdón es más que solo palabras que se intercambian entre las personas cuando se ha cometido un pecado, es una elección de toda la persona que ha sido agraviada. Esa elección, aunque es difícil, glorifica a Dios.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoshua Greiner is an ACBC-certified counselor and Fellow.

I think I have seven books on my shelf on forgiveness, and they all land differently on this issue: What does it mean to cover sin?\\nHere I’ll attempt to introduce you to the issues at play in this topic, and I’m going to propose what I believe is not only an exegetical view, but also correlational view (all of what Scripture teaches on the subject).\\nI have been studying this particular topic for years. Forgiveness is a very everyday issue. We sin every day, multiple times—sins of omission and sins of commission. What do we do with that? When we sin against one another, what do we do with that? And what does God teach us to do when someone clearly sins against us?\\nI don’t look for sin in other people. We’re not sin hunters. Sometimes a caricature of biblical counselors is that people come in and they say, “We need help.” And we respond, “Okay, where’s the sin?” We don’t go looking for sin, but often it comes across our path or it’s against us in some way.\\nWe’re taught in 1 Corinthians 13 that love believes the best. We want to think the best about other people. We want to put the best spin on things, even when it’s doubtful. But when it is a clear infraction of God’s Word against us or someone else, how do we respond to that as Christians one to another?\\nEarly on I was taught in biblical counseling that what you do with a majority of sin is, “You cover it.” I was taught that you should overlook sin or ignore it. When I was taught that, I raised my hand in the class and said, “So what sins do you cover? And which ones do you deal with?”\\nThat’s a common question. I mean, I don’t want to get that wrong. I don’t want to be dealing with someone’s sin against me if I should be overlooking it. My instructor replied, “You cover what you can cover, unless the sin blows the covers off.”\\nI remember my hand went down, but the look on my face was, “What does that mean?”\\nThe Corinthian church was covering some pretty serious issues—even a man involved sexually with his stepmother in 1 Corinthians 5. Some people in churches can cover a lot, they ignore and overlook anything. Then there’s others who you just look at them wrong and they’re coming after you needing to talk about it.\\n“You cover what you can cover, until the sin blows the covers off.” I wrote it down. It didn’t make much sense to me, but it was my first exposure to the biblical counseling. I went back to the place where I was pastoring and I began to teach these biblical counseling principles—applied theology in the church. And in training others, when it came to this issue of sin, I taught that you deal seriously with sin. Then a hand would go up. Maybe sometimes multiple hands would go up. And they would ask, “How do you know what to cover what not to cover?”\\nAnd you know what my reply was? “You cover what you can cover, unless the sin blows the covers off.” I saw the same expressions on their faces that was on mine originally. Then I finally went out to Grace Community Church and I was on staff there, and I was teaching in the counseling training time.\\nI read 1 Peter 4:8, which says, “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.” And I said to the class, “You don’t deal with every sin—just some sins, because love covers a multitude of them.” Then hands went up and I did not look up, because I was not going to say, “You cover what you can cover, unless the sin blows the covers off” one more time.\\nAnd at that point when I saw those hands go up in that class I said to myself, “I have got to look at what the Scripture teaches about what love covers and when.”\\nWhat does all of the Bible teach on it?\\nSecond Timothy 2:15, says “Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.” That’s what I’m attempting to do. Not that I do that perfectly, but I want to study the Word well. I want to look at the relevant passages and the theme of Scripture as well. How does all of Scripture teach on the subject? Not just one verse. Sometimes people take one verse and make a whole theology out of it, and you get into trouble that way. The Bible has one divine author—the Holy Spirit. He doesn’t contradict himself.\\nIf the Spirit’s bringing different verses up, then you put them all together.\\nIn Acts 17:11, talking about the Bereans, Scripture says, “they received the word with great eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.” I would encourage you to be a good Berean. As we get to the end, I’m going to attempt to say what you cover and when you cover sin. Study the Scriptures that I bring up. You take a look at them and you see if I’ve done something wrong, please let me know. I don’t want to exceed what’s written (1 Corinthians 4:6). God has given us His Word. We don’t want to go beyond it.\\nCase Study\\nA case study can help us get our minds around this concept. Joe and Susan are both professing Christians since their teenage years. They’ve been married for 12 years and have three children (ages seven, five, and a newborn). Susan is a homeschooling mom. Joe has one of those management jobs that seems to be an all-consuming job with no end. He brings it home and works on things even at night.\\nThis particular day he woke up late—no time in the Word or prayer in any devotional kind of way. A coworker misrepresented him at work that day. His computer had all kinds of problems—he lost some information that he didn’t save. One of his extended family members called during the lunch break, and so there goes his lunch. He had a very frustrating day.\\nHe didn’t even get a third done on his to-do list. He doesn’t even focus or think about the Lord or pray for grace most of the day. On the way home, he can’t wait to get home and rest. Traffic is slow. He can’t understand why anyone is on the road when he’s going home. He can’t wait to eat one of his favorite meals that he hinted to his wife on the way out that morning that he would like that night. He’s expecting his wife and kids to have no problems when he arrives.\\nIn his mind, he was thinking of how they all would greet them when he pulls up and say, “We’re glad you’re home. How can we serve you tonight?” He wants a trouble-free night with no inconveniences.\\nSusan has an equally rough day. She didn’t rest at all that night with the newborn. None of the children have been very cooperative all day. Especially the oldest boy, who was in need of discipline most all day. Homeschooling was a complete disaster. She doesn’t even have what she would need to fix the dinner that Joe hinted at on the way out in the morning. Half an hour before Joe arrives, a lady at church calls her, distraught.\\nShe wants to talk about the problems that she was having and so Susan seeks to minister to her, and she is on the phone when Joe arrives.\\nJoe walks in—the place is a complete mess, the kids seem wild. No aroma of dinner meets his nostrils. Susan is talking on the phone and Joe assume she’s been on the phone all day. He hurries her off the phone and then asks, “What have you been doing all day?”\\nSusan responds, “I can’t believe you would ask such a thing.” And Joe responds, “Well, this is your domain. Obviously, you can’t handle it. Maybe you need to go back to work and we hire someone who can.”\\nSusan replies, “You self-centered jerk. You’re always thinking of yourself.” Joe responds, “Well, who else will think of me? Since when do you ever think of me? I guess I’ll have to just take care of myself.”\\nSusan begins to cry and walks away. Joe feels justified, so he just goes upstairs to the bedroom to change. Soon, it’s time for dinner. And so they both just focus on the kids—taking out their anger on the kids. Further, the oldest boy was forbidden to go outside and play since he was a complete mess all day, but Joe said to him, “Sure you can go out and play.” He undid everything Susan had been trying to teach him. Susan cleans up after dinner, gives the kids a bath, gets the kids to bed, then she retires herself to bed—watching TV before she falls asleep. Joe goes up to the den and works until late hours of the night.\\nThen when Susan is asleep, Joe goes to bed. The next day, neither Joe nor Susan bring up the previous day. They just press on with the next day.\\nWas there any sin committed? What do you cover? What do you what do you ignore or overlook? What do you deal with? And when do you deal with it?\\nBecause in their minds, the past was the past. That was yesterday, we just press on now, it’s water under the bridge. Day after day, this is how their marriage is going.\\nPresent Day Views\\nNow we’ll explore some different views on this issues of what love covers.\\nThe first is a very liberal view: Love covers everything or almost everything. People with this view may say, “I’m just very thick skinned. I can handle all kinds of sin. It doesn’t bother me—like water off a duck’s back.” Or some would say, “I take the high road, so I don’t deal with much sin at all.”\\nAs I mentioned, 1 Corinthians 5 would fit in here. The church was overlooking (maybe they thought they were covering) the sin of one Corinthian at church who was involved sexually with his stepmother.\\nA second, more moderate view is that love covers some sins, personal offenses for example. But not other sins—the major, weighty ones like adultery, embezzlement, or major abuse. In this category, there’s usually a man-made list. In the books on forgiveness, you’ll find lists—these sins you deal with, these things you don’t deal with.\\nI remember reading in one list, “Wait until a sin becomes habitual.” We know how hard it is to deal with sins that become a habit! Don’t wait until the sin comes a habit. That’s a deep ravine. Nip it in the bud. They use man-made lists because there’s no biblical list. Man has to come up with their own lists to instruct you what sins to deal with and which ones to cover, ignore, or overlook.\\nThere’s a third view—not the most popular—that love doesn’t cover any clear sins, until the sin is first dealt with. You don’t overlook it. The Old Testament word to cover means to atone, to hide, or bury it.\\nAnd you bury it at the end of the process, not at the beginning of the process.\\nPerplexities\\nThere are a lot of perplexities and questions that are raised in this issue.\\nHow do you define various terms? For example, how would you define sin? As 1 John tells us, sin is lawlessness. Sin is any want of conformity to or transgression of the law of God. How would you define immaturity? How would you define what real love is? Because it’s a sentimentality today, often it’s a therapeutic love in the church, but not a biblical love at times. Proverbs 27:5-6 says, “Better is open rebuke than hidden love.\\xa0Faithful are the wounds of a friend;\\xa0profuse are the kisses of an enemy.”\\nPeople may say, “I love them too much to talk to them about a sin that they just committed against me.” No, you don’t love them enough.\\nThis is what’s going on in the church today. “I just overlooked that, I just cover it.” You don’t love people enough. It’s about their sanctification and God’s glory—that’s what we should be thinking about.\\nHow would you define repentance and confession and forgiveness and different terms like that?\\nSecondly, who determines what sins to cover and what sins to bring up? Because the Bible has no list. Man may come up with a list, but God’s Word provides no list of what to deal with and what not to deal with when it comes to clear sins against a brother or sister in Christ.\\nHow does the love covering principle fit into forgiveness? This depends on what your view is on forgiveness; there are different views on forgiveness. Some think forgiveness is unconditional—you forgive people regardless of whether they repent or not. Some would say you forgive your brother in your heart and then if it is a serious enough issue, you would go talk with them. But a lot of things you can overlook and let them go.\\nOr is forgiveness conditional? Where you have a heart that’s always willing to forgive, a heart that pursues forgiveness, a heart that loves people unconditionally, but seeks to remedy the issue that sin has caused. Then once it’s confessed and repented of, you cover it.\\nFor example in 1 Thessalonians 5:14, how do you love someone who is unruly? Love admonishes the unruly, but don’t make love equal to admonishment. Don’t take that verse and say, “Every person you meet—no matter what’s going on in their life—you just admonish them.”\\nLove admonishes the unruly in 1 Thessalonians 5, but how does love express itself to people who are weak? You help the weak. Don’t help the unruly, don’t help the lazy sponger (the one who refuses to work who can work). Help the weak.\\nHow do you love those who are fainthearted? By looking at 1 Thessalonians 5:14, you encourage the fainthearted. You don’t encourage the unruly, you admonish the unruly. You help the weak, you encourage the fainthearted.\\nWhat do you do with someone who is in rebellion, refusing to obey? You discipline them. You get into the process described in Matthew 18. Yet, you wouldn’t say love equals discipline—where everyone you love, you discipline.\\nLove is bigger. It’s broader. It’s like a huge umbrella. It’s a foundation, and love manifests itself differently in different situations.\\nWhat do you do when someone has sinned against you, and they come to you and say, “Please forgive me. I’ve done wrong.” You forgive them and then you cover it. That is what I’m proposing as we look through these various passages of Scripture. As I look at all of the texts of Scripture, that’s what love does. Love does not overlook any clear sin and ignore it.\\nAnd I’ll explain a process for this—I think you don’t always have to bring admonishment to other Christians when they sin against you. We’ll walk through that. That’s how I see it all fits together. Love displays itself differently depending on what’s going on in someone’s life, but don’t make love equal to any one of those.\\n“Love Covering” in Scripture\\nKing David wrote Psalm 32, and he describes what his life was like before confessing his sin with Bathsheba and putting her husband to death, and after he confessed, which we have written out in Psalm 51. Psalm 32 says,\\nBlessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven,\\nwhose sin is covered.\\nBlessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity,\\nand in whose spirit there is no deceit.\\nFor when I kept silent, my bones wasted away\\nthrough my groaning all day long.\\nFor day and night your hand was heavy upon me;\\nmy strength was dried up as by the heat of summer. Selah\\nI acknowledged my sin to you,\\nand I did not cover my iniquity;\\nI said, “I will confess my transgressions to the Lord,”\\nand you forgave the iniquity of my sin. Selah\\nThat is a powerful passage. When was sin covered? Well, David tried covering his sin (overlooking it and hiding it) before he confessed it. He describes the misery he felt when he did that. But once he confessed, and he was forgiven by God, as he says there in verse 1, his sin was covered. Covering came at the end of the process. When he tried to cover his own sin first, he did not prosper.\\nRemember the word cover is kəvər in the Hebrew language. It’s the word for atonement—your sins are covered.\\nIn the Old Testament sacrificial system, when were their sins atoned for? When were their sins covered? At the end of the sacrificial process, not before. Of course, all were paid by Christ on the cross. He paid for the sins that were confessed in the Old Testament.\\nProverbs 10:12 will really set you on a journey. This verse says, “Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses.”\\nI believe this is saying when someone sins against you, take care of it and then cover it. Cover all the transgressions that you have dealt with. Click To Tweet\\nThis is problematic if you say, “Well, if cover means overlook and ignore, you mean we just ignore all of them and never deal with any sins?” I believe this is saying when someone sins against you, take care of it and then cover it. Cover all the transgressions that you have dealt with. And then the Hebrew parallelism shows us that if you don’t deal with the sin and cover it, the opposite is you start spreading people’s sins around. Hatred will stir up strife. You’ll see another Proverb very similar to this. Hatred spreads and gossips and slanders. But love goes to the person in private, deals with the issue, and then buries it.\\nProverbs 17:9 says, “Whoever covers an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates close friends.”\\nThis is very similar to the other Proverb we just read. He who covers a transgression seeks love. Love will say, “I want to resolve this issue and then cover it.”\\nThe nature of sin is to be anti-relational. It’s anti-unity, anti-submission, anti-obedience, anti-rational, anti-love, and it’s anti-Christ. Sin is serious, so we want to deal with that. You cover a transgression and the rest of Scripture would say, “Deal with it and then cover it.” But if you don’t, you start spreading it around and “repeating a matter”—that’s not what love does, that’s what hate does.\\nProverbs 19:11 uses a different word—not the word for cover, but the word for overlook. The verse says, “Good sense makes one slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense.” The word “overlook” here literally means “let it pass by.”\\nAnd the Hebrew parallelism is: If you don’t let it pass by, what’s the other reaction you’re tempted to do? Anger. When someone sins against you, the typical fleshly reaction is, “I’m going to come right back at you in my anger. You just sinned against me. I’m coming at you.”\\nThis Proverb is saying it’s the glory of a man to initially let it pass by. It’s not teaching a whole theology on what to do with sin, because sin needs to be dealt with. But that Proverb helps us know that it’s not our knee-jerk reaction to deal with sin properly.\\nThis is similar to the principle in Proverbs 15:1, “A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” We are not to go with our knee-jerk response, but initially let the issue past by.\\nLet’s say someone’s spouse comes home, and they’re angry and they say some hurtful things right at the start when they see you. Initially, let that pass by. And then say, “Honey, what’s wrong?” They may describe, “Oh this happened, and then this happened, and then that happened.” It’s good to initially let it pass by. But that sin that they did against you needs to be dealt with. It doesn’t go away. It’s always the nature of sin to separate. Starting in Genesis 3, it separates God and man, and man with man.\\nYou can come back and deal with the sin of their original response. And you want to do that, and not just wave it off.\\nProverbs 27:5-6 says, “Better is open rebuke than hidden love.\\xa0Faithful are the wounds of a friend;\\xa0profuse are the kisses of an enemy.”\\nProverbs 28:13 says, “Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.” David is an illustration of Proverbs 28, when he tried to conceal his transgressions initially. Once he dealt with it, he found mercy and compassion. It’s interesting that Solomon picks up on this.\\nFirst Corinthians 13:5 says, love “does not take into account a wrong suffered.” What does it mean to take into account here? In Romans 4 Paul uses the same phrase, “take into an account.” That’s same phrase used by the same human author. This is how he brings it up in Romans 4:6-8, “just as David also speaks of the blessing on the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:\\n‘Blessed are those whose lawless deeds have been forgiven,\\nAnd whose sins have been covered.’\\n‘Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not take into account.'”\\nGod does not take into an account a wrong suffered after it’s been dealt with. We know that because Paul quotes David in this passage. David confessed, his sins are forgiven, and they’re covered. God no longer takes into an account—that same phrase is used by Paul in both places.\\nJames 5:19-20 says, “My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back, let him know that he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.” Covering of a multitude of sins comes at the end of this process, not at the beginning in James 5.\\nNow, we look to 1 Peter 4:8. This is written to a church in a suffering environment, facing persecution. The thing you want as a church when you’re being persecuted or suffering is to pull together. You don’t want division amongst yourselves, with hatred stirring up strife everywhere. Rather, Peter says, “Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins.”\\nPeople read that and think it means you overlook or ignore a bunch of sin—you don’t ever deal with it. Yet, the rest of Scripture helps us understand that you deal with sin, and then you hide it and cover it. Then it’s done and that pulls a church together.\\nPresuppositions for the “Love Covering” Principle\\nNow we’ll see some presuppositions in dealing with the love covering principle.\\nGod’s purpose is to grow us in holiness. We’ve been set apart in sanctification and God desires to grow us in holiness (1 Peter 1:16).\\nAll sin is serious (Genesis 3, Romans 6:23). As Alexander Maclaren says, “It might be a small act, but it is a great sin.”\\nThe nature of sin is to separate (Genesis 3, Isaiah 59:2). We see this when people say in counseling, “It’s like there’s a distance between us.” This is how Joe is with Susan in our case study from earlier. He came home and sin was exchanged between them day after day. This leads to a distance between them, because that’s what sin does—sin separates.\\nYou’ll hear people say in counseling, “There’s like a wall between us.” One brick of sin undealt with at a time will build a wall quickly.\\nThe Bible doesn’t give a complete detailed list of sins to cover and sins to deal with. It just says in Matthew 18 or Luke 17, if a brother sins against you, you go to them in private. You realize there is a sin or offense between the two of you, you go to them, you leave what you’re doing, and you resolve that.\\nEven in Ephesians 4, “Don’t let the sun go down on your anger.” Deal with sin and deal with it quickly.\\nThere’s an apparent conditional aspect to dealing with sin. This is a theme running through Scripture: confession, repentance, and then forgiveness. It’s a constant theme running from the Old Testament, to the gospels, to the epistles. You can see this in passages such as Proverbs 27:5-6, Proverbs 28:13, Matthew 18:15ff, and Luke 17:2.\\nThe heart is always to reflect love, humility, mercy, kindness, and compassion to everyone. Click To Tweet\\nThe heart is always to reflect love, humility, mercy, kindness, and compassion to everyone. This is God’s grace in our lives to be free from anger, not having knee-jerk reactions, free from bitterness and revenge. Have a spirit that’s always willing to forgive (Ephesians 4:32). We should pursue reconciliation with the person who has a clear offense against you.\\nI think bitterness is misunderstood. It’s not an absence of offering forgiveness to the person who sinned against you. Bitterness is when there’s a lack of love towards the person who has offended you. Bitterness is not an absence of offering forgiveness. That’s a mistaken concept. If person raped my daughter, to say “You have to forgive the person or you’ll get bitter.” Yet, he’s not even acknowledged to sin. Really, it’s if I stop actively loving that offender, then I will get bitter.\\nIf Jesus forgave everyone who sinned against him, no one would go to hell. But He has a heart willing to forgive. Psalm 86:5 says, “For You, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive.”\\nPondering the “Love Covering” Principle\\nHow does God deal with sin and instruct us to deal with it in the Old Testament, the gospels, and the epistles?\\nWhen there is a clear offense one against the other, we are instructed to go to them. If they don’t come to you, you go and talk to them. Then once the person says, “I have sinned, please forgive me,” then it is immediately forgiven and covered.\\nAre there examples of sins that were seemingly covered before dealing with the sin? Some would go to the example of Joseph with his brothers. There’s no direct statement that he forgave his brothers. He was willing to forgive them. It seems like they perhaps owned that what they did was wrong, but there’s not a real clear teaching there. You can definitely see with Joseph that there was a heart that loved his brothers, that was willing to forgive his brothers, but they still dealt with the guilt even after their dad died. They think, “Oh, now we’re in trouble.” You definitely see a reflection of God’s heart of love and a willingness to forgive in Joseph.\\nThere’s the example of David with Shimei from 2 Samual 16. People say, “Look at how he dealt with Shimei.” We shouldn’t call that forgiveness, because David tells his son Solomon to kill Shimei when Solomon becomes king. That’s not what you do when you forgive people. In 2 Samual 19 we see David’s love, David’s willingness to forgive Shimei, but Shimei could not be trusted.\\nYou have the example Stephen with Saul. As Stephen was being stoned to death, he looked up and saw Christ standing there and he said, “Lay this not to their account.” That was a prayer request, it was not a pronouncement or a granting of Paul’s forgiveness of an unrighteous stoning. It was a prayer request that shows Stephen’s heart that was very similar to God’s heart. And a few days later, Paul repents on the Damascus Road—God did forgive him and did not lay it to his account. There was forgiveness of all of his sins, including the unrighteous stoning of Stephen.\\nJesus on the cross is another example of a prayer request, not a pronouncement. He’s talking to his heavenly Father and says, “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.” That was not a pronouncement, but a prayer request showing the heart of God—willing to forgive and actively loving His enemies.\\nFifty days later, in Acts 2, you have Peter preaching and he’s talking to the same people who murdered Jesus. He says, “You murdered him.” They said, “What can we do?” And he responds, “Repent and believe,” and many did. Jesus’ prayer was answered.\\nSome people ask about Mark 11:25-26 where it’s a present, active imperative. The verses say, “Whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you your transgressions. But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions.”\\nDoes that teach unconditional forgiveness? Remember the end of the verse, “neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your transgressions,” which is absolutely conditional. It seems to say love is unconditional—just forgive people. Yet, the verse before it says, “all things for which you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and they will be granted you.” You don’t want to make a theology out of that verse—it’s already been done in the prosperity cult. You have to look at all of Scripture on prayer. You have to pray according to His revealed will, you have to be doing what God says. There are qualifications to praying—not just pray whatever you want and it will be done for you. With forgiveness too, we must ask, what does all of Scripture say about forgiveness? Bring all of that into the passage in Mark 11. Then you would assume you’ve already dealt with the sin, and when you are praying, you keep on forgiving.\\nIf you don’t, God won’t forgive you. This is stated very similarly in the Lord’s prayer, and the other gospel accounts. We also see it in Matthew 18, with the king who forgave all of the servant’s debt. It says the master forgave the servant, “because you pleaded with me.” That’s conditional. The king had a heart of compassion, and he said, “I forgave you because you pleaded with me,” now you should have the same heart toward your fellow servant. Because the servant didn’t forgive his fellow servant, then the master was moved with anger.\\nDealing With Our Own Heart\\nYou want to deal with clear sin, with a brother or sister in Christ, for their sanctification and God's glory. Click To Tweet\\nWhy do we deal with sin when someone has offended you? Sin separates. You want to deal with clear sin, with a brother or sister in Christ, for their sanctification and God’s glory. It’s not about how thick your skin is. It’s not about saying, “I can handle it.” It’s about thinking, “I want my brother or sister to grow in their Christian life and sin has brought a separation. I want God to be glorified.” That’s what has to motivate you to love people properly. It’s not about your hurt.\\nOne’s loving attitude needs to be this way toward everyone:\\nHumble. You don’t come in a self-righteous way, but as a fellow sinner and sufferer (Philippians 2:1-11; Ephesians 4:1-3).\\nConsider yourself first—ask, “Did I do something to provoke this issue?”\\xa0(Matthew 7:3-5).\\nSeek peace, as much as possible as it depends on you (Romans 12:18; Ephesians 4:3).\\nBe patient with them (1 Thessalonians 5:14).\\nGo after a full inquiry into the matter (Proverbs 18:13, 17; 2 Corinthians 13:1).\\nHaving a gentle spirit (2 Timothy 2:24-26).\\nYet, there are many rationalizations of our heart. These are things that people bring up when they don’t want to deal with a clear sin against them.\\n▪ “It’s no big deal.” Yet, really it is a big deal to God. It brings separation, and it doesn’t just “go away.”\\n▪ “Compared to others—not that serious.” It’s unwise to compare yourself one to another (2 Corinthians 10).\\n▪ “It’s not my responsibility to confront.”\\n▪ “My skin is thick –I can handle it.”\\n▪ “Take the high road.”\\n▪ “If you dealt with every clear sin from a brother or sister in Christ, you’ll be doing this all day.” This is the one I hear a lot. I don’t know who you’re around that sins outwardly against you all day long. If you’re dealing with that in a person’s life all day long, you’re probably dealing with an unbeliever, not a Christian. And in that situation, you shouldn’t be bringing up every sin they commit to an unbeliever—that’s all they can do.\\n▪ “I’d be some sort of Gestapo.”\\n▪ “Graciousness is letting sin go.”\\n▪ “No one is perfect, I’m only human.”\\n▪ “It’s too late, the past is the past, it’s water under the bridge.”\\n▪ “This would be an unforgiving spirit.”\\n▪ “My goal is ‘peace’ and this might lead to conflict.”\\n▪ “I don’t think what they are doing is sinful.”\\n▪ “If I deal with their sin in this area, then I’ll have to deal with it in my life as well.”\\n▪ “This would be so time-consuming—I hate the hassle.”\\n▪ “This is “Law” and not “Gospel Grace.””\\nThe above excuses are all self-oriented, rather than loving the person and God’s glory. If you have people in your life who seek to deal with sins you have committed against them, you will sin less. If you park a State Trooper car along the freeway every mile, even without a police officer in it, you’ll see traffic patterns change. You want people in your life who love you, who want your sanctification and God’s glory.\\nHow do we deal with the sins of another? It must be dealt with graciously, reasonably, righteously, and consistently. The manner in which you forgive needs to be in line with Ephesians 4:23, “Forgive as God in Christ has forgiven you.”\\nThere’s a methodology of how you deal with sin—but this is more about the manner in which you deal with it. It uses the word “grace,” charizomai in Greek—it’s a grace forgiveness. Forgive graciously, reasonably, righteously, and consistently.\\nPractical Application\\nHow do you deal with the offenses of an unsaved person? The Scripture doesn’t tell us a lot on this area. Their biggest need as unbelievers is the gospel of Jesus Christ. They are under the law of sin, their nature is to sin, so they have to sin. They love to sin. We’re not told to deal with every sin in their lives. We bring the law of God to bear as a tutor to point them to Christ. Their greatest need though is God’s judicial forgiveness. We should seek to bring the gospel to bear on their life. There’s not a lot in Scripture on dealing with the sins of unbelievers—it’s just not there. What we have on confronting sin is for dealing with the family of God.\\nHowever, if they commit sin that’s criminal, you should report it. That’s clear from Matthew 5, Romans 13, 1 Peter 2, and Romans 12.\\nIf sinned against by an unbelievers, always be willing to suffer for Christ. We should pray for the offender, put off vengeance, turn away from anger and bitterness, and have an intentional and aggressive love toward the unbeliever (Matthew 5, 1 Peter 2, Romans 12:14-21, Proverbs 19, Matthew 5). This is what it looks like to actively love and have a heart ready to forgive (Psalm 86:5).\\nWhat about dealing with the sins of believers?\\nThis is a suggestion using different Proverbs and principles. When a believer sins against you,\\n1. Pray for and examine yourself first (Matthew 7:3-5). Then pray for them. We’re told that in 1 John, to pray for the brother or sister who’s sinning.\\n2. After some time, if that person doesn’t come to you and ask forgiveness, go to them and ask questions (Proverbs 18:13). You may not even have gotten the facts right. Maybe you misheard what they said. Let’s say for example, I’ve been angry with my wife. And at first she lets that pass by and asks about my day, seeking to comfort me. If later, I didn’t come back and ask for forgiveness for some very hurtful things that I said, she can say, “Honey, I’m so glad you’re doing better right now. But did I hear right when you came in, saying X, Y, and Z?” Questions will prick the conscience. Any Christian who loves Jesus will be convicted and then be able to respond rightly by asking forgiveness from God and the other person. Then it’s done. There’s no admonishment necessary in that case, just ask questions. Usually issues are resolved from these first two steps—the sin is dealt with and covered. But if the offender says, “Yea, I did say that and I meant it,” then we can move along in the process.\\n3. Bring Scriptures to bear. Now we’re under the authority of God and His Word. If the person says, “I don’t care what Scripture says,” that’s a more serious issue than what they said to you earlier. They’ve got a bigger heart problem. Again, this is not all in five minutes, it takes time when you are concerned for their sanctification and God’s glory. If they say they don’t care what the Bible says, then you can move onto the fourth step.\\n4. After some time, ask another believer or two to go with you (Matthew 18:15-20; Romans 12:18). That’s the spirit of Matthew 18—the intent of keeping a unity for the glory of the Lord and the sanctification of believers.\\n5. If it becomes this serious, then it could be a whole church matter (but not because of the first sin issue, but their entire life is troubling as over time their heart is hardened about sin in their life and they refuse to humble themselves or submit to God’s Word).\\nJohn MacArthur, in his commentary on 1 John says, “Although God mercifully does not immediately punish every sin with death, every sin is nonetheless a serious matter to Him. Every sin is a violation of His law and an affront to God and to be confessed and forsaken and mortified.”\\nWhen we deal with the sins of others against us, there are a number of principles to keep in mind.\\n1. Only clear violations of God’s commands are to be dealt with. Not matters of conscience or preference issues, not motives of the heart, not physical maturity issues, not wisdom issues, not halo data. You don’t confront on those things. You confront when there is a clear breach of God’s Word.\\n2. Confrontation must be done in love (Proverbs 27:5-6).\\n3. Realize we are members of one another (1 Corinthians 5; 1 Corinthians 12; Ephesians 4:25).\\n4. Have a heart always ready to forgive (Psalm 86:5).\\n5. There is the humble and loving inquiry. Consider your timing even and be sensitive to when is a good time to talk about the subject.\\n6. There ought to be acknowledgment and confession (repentance).\\n7. When forgiveness is asked, then there is forgiveness—a “release” from the heart outward, which is immediate and unlimited. Now someone saying, “I’m just sorry”—I don’t know what that means. It could mean you’re sorry you got caught, or you’re sorry that I’m bothered. That isn’t a good confession. A repentant confession owns up to what is wrong and explains how they plan to do differently next time—to confess and forsake.\\n8. Coupled with forgiveness is “covering the sins,” where you bury, keep no record, blot it out, and hide it (Psalm 32, James 5). With forgiveness, the sin is buried.\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, take all sin seriously! (Romans 12:9; 1 Peter 1:13-16).\\nThe process seems to be (among Christians) to have the right heart—always loving, always having “a “forgiving spirit” that is willing to forgive. We pray and ask questions, and if necessary humbly and graciously confront in love (Proverbs 27:5-6). Upon confession and repentance, then forgive and cover.\\nIf no sin is dealt with, there won’t be any purity a person’s life or in the church. There will be lots of what the BIble calls “leaven,” and a little leaven can leaven the whole lump (1 Corinthians 5).\\nIf only some sin is dealt with, there will be some purity, but there will still be “leaven,” some skewed relationships where glorifying God is hindered.\\nAs much as we attempt to love one another with Christlike love, when clear violations of Scripture are dealt with, then there’s purity and love,\\xa0genuineness, spiritual growth, God’s truth is honored, godly relationships, God’s glory is put on display, and Christians show true Christlikeness.\\nThe place to start is in your own walk with Christ. Ask other believers to point out where you clearly sin against them. Don’t hide it or ignore it or overlook it, rather tell them to, “Please talk to me about any sin you see in me.” Start with your own life first. Then in time you can explain it and practice it in your relationships with one another, for the glory of God. Be a good Berean on this topic—you have the passages I’ve listed. Think it through to see what the Spirit of God teaches in His Word concerning what to cover and when to cover in regard to an offense against you from a fellow brother or sister in Christ.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStuart Scott is ACBC’s Director of Member Care\\xa0and Professor of Biblical Counseling at Bob Jones University and Seminary in Greenville, SC.\", 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

They sting. The apostle Paul talks about this and other sins to his protege Titus,\\nFor we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy,\\xa0hated\\xa0by others and\\xa0hating one another. But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:3–5).\\nIf we are honest, we still struggle from time to time with feelings of anger, hurt, resentment, and perhaps even hate. Sanctification is a journey of conformity to Christ day-by-day and step-by-step. When your counselees face conflict or we face conflict, how do we move to forgiveness and love? As we approach Easter, Jesus’ last words have an answer.\\nPoint to Jesus\\nThe first thing Jesus said as he died on the cross was, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:24). He came to the earth to offer forgiveness. As he suffered injustice, he was an example, par excellence, of granting forgiveness. Pointing your people to Jesus helps inspire forgiveness.\\nHowever, what if they feel they don’t have it in them to forgive? What if the person you counsel sees Jesus’ example and concludes, “I could never do that. Jesus is God. I am not. I can’t forgive. My hurt is too big.”? How do you help a person move from hatred, anger, resentment, and hurt to loving forgiveness when it seems impossible?\\nIf they see their inability, that is not bad. Point them back to Jesus and his words. In John 15, he said, that we are the branches and he is the vine. We can’t do any good thing apart form him. Jesus knew it is impossible to obey on our own; that is why he came and died and rose again. We can’t love and forgive without God’s help. We need his help. Direct their gaze to Jesus and the help he offers.\\nIdentify Barriers\\nIn pointing them to Jesus, help them identify his or her barriers to follow Christ. What holds them back? Do they hang on to an offense? What hurts and injustices do they carry? What is their motivation for not wanting to forgive someone? Often people are unaware of what is going on inside of themselves.\\nHave your counselees describe what they are thinking and feeling, not just what others have done to them. Sometimes those emotions are indicative of desires that are out of balance. James 4 tells us what causes quarrels. Conflict arises from expectations and wishes and longings that exceed what God would have. We want our way, our plan, and our vision, so we do whatever we can to get it. We cut corners. That drive begins to rule us, control us, and dictate our lives, not God’s Word. Understanding when that happens helps move the counselee to the next step: confession.\\nConfess Sin\\nAnother name for unbalanced desires is idolatry. Seeing one’s idolatry is an opportunity. Help them step back and reflect on what is going on in them and how that impacts their relationships and situation is critical. This is not saying they are to blame for the wrong done to them. However, Jesus made it clear that addressing your own sin is the first step in moving forward, before trying to resolve a circumstance through confrontation. He said something to the effect of, take the two-by-four out of your own eye before doing Lasik surgery on your neighbor (Matthew 7:5). Two-by-fours get in the way of eye surgery.\\nHow does one follow Christ’s example of love and forgiveness? Knowing one’s barriers and confession helps. In Matthew 18, Jesus tells a story that illustrates the irony of unforgiveness. A forgiven person grasping what Jesus has done for their specific wrongs helps one grow in mercy.\\nEmbrace faith\\xa0\\nThat leads to the second saying of Christ on the cross, which also deals with forgiveness. In Jesus’ first saying, he asked the Father to forgive because of ignorance. In his second, he extended grace and mercy to a single sinner based on faith.\\nJesus said, “Today you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43). Two thieves died next to him. One verbally mocked Jesus while the other defended him. The mocking thief didn’t believe Jesus, while the defending one did. The defender asked Jesus to remember him when he came into his kingdom. He had nothing to offer Jesus. He had no religious pedigree that we know of, only immorality. He knew Jesus had done nothing wrong, unlike himself. Yet, he asked Jesus for mercy. That request demonstrated his faith that death wouldn’t hold Jesus back.\\xa0His focus was not on those who hurt him, but his own need for mercy.\\nHelp your counselees see Jesus as this believing criminal did. If they don’t believe, helping them love and forgive will be like stapling fruit on a fruit tree. It won’t get at the root of their issue. Recognition of one’s sin and sinful nature is critical. Seeing their need, point them to the hope of Scripture. Jesus conquered sin at the cross. He provided forgiveness and grace in his death. He was and is the only hope for change. His promise to the thief can become your counselee’s by faith.\\nDoes the person believe Jesus? Does he or she believe the Scripture? It is sufficient to help them move from hatred to love. Applied rightly, through the Spirit, the Bible opens blind eyes and softens hearts. Help them embrace faith in God’s grace in their lives to empower them to offer grace to others. Paul says it this way, “the love of Christ controls us” (2 Corinthians 5:14).\\nJoin me in using the Word of God to minister to the souls of men for God’s glory and everyone’s joy this Easter.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRobert Nash is an ACBC certified counselor and serves as a pastor at Sawyer Highlands Church in Southwest Michigan.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Should I Forgive Someone Who’s Not Sorry They Sinned?', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 53', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Forgiveness 12', 'question': 'Learn about forgiveness as an action and as an attitude.', 'body': \"Heath Lambert: This week, we’re going to talk about forgiveness on the podcast. I have often said that one of the most controversial teachings in the Bible is the teaching of the command to forgive. One particular example of this is in Matthew 18, where Jesus gives the most extensive teaching on forgiveness in the Bible. And he tells the story of an unforgiving servant. He tells this story about a man who’s forgiven a massive debt but will not then turn around and forgive his fellow servant, a comparatively smaller debt. And he is punished for his lack of forgiveness by being thrown into prison by his master until the text says he should pay the last penalty. The haunting words that come at the end of Jesus’ parable come from Jesus himself. And in Matthew 18:35, it says, “My heavenly Father will also do the same to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart.” So this is a command to forgive, and not to forgive even superficially, but to forgive at a profound level in the heart. I say that this is controversial because, as people living in a fallen world, we can be sinned against in profound ways. And so we must forgive; we’re commanded by Jesus Christ to forgive, but knowing that we are commanded to forgive does not answer all the questions, does it, Amy?\\nAmy Evensen: No, and I think many people wonder. Okay, Jesus wants me to forgive, but should I only forgive someone if they’ve asked for this forgiveness, or should I forgive those who aren’t sorry over their sin?\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, this question is the one Christians spend the most time talking about. We know, as Christians who have been forgiven of our sins by Jesus, that we must forgive others. But the real practical question is, should I forgive if someone’s not sorry that they sinned against me? Should I forgive if someone has not asked for forgiveness? And the issue is actually raised even by texts of Scripture. So, for example, you’ve got a text like Mark 11:25, and Jesus says, “whenever you stand praying, forgive if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in heaven will also forgive you, your transgressions.” So this sounds like Jesus is saying we forgive whether someone has asked for forgiveness or not, whether they are sorry or not. We just forgive—if we’re standing there, praying, we forgive. But then you’ve got a text like Luke 17:3-4, where Jesus also says, “be on your guard if your brother sins rebuke him, and if he repents forgive him, and if he sins against you seven times a day and returns to you seven times a day saying, ‘I repent forgive him.'” So you’ve got these two teachings of Jesus. Jesus, on the one hand, says, if standing there praying and you realize there’s a problem with your brother, then forgive him so that you’ll be heard in your prayers. And then you’ve got this statement of Jesus that says, forgive your brother when he repents. And so, how do we solve this apparent dilemma?\\nI think it helps us to think in two categories. I think we can think of forgiveness, on the one hand, as an action that transpires in relationship, and we can think of forgiveness, on the other hand, as an attitude that we cultivate in our soul. Jesus, in Mark 11, is talking about forgiveness as an attitude that we cultivate in our soul. When he says that if you’re standing there praying, forgive, he’s saying to release that person from your anger, from your bitterness, and from the penalty of your sin right there. He’s talking about cultivating an action in our heart; we might say, that is the willingness to extend forgiveness. But we settle the matter in our heart whether or not they’re sorry, whether or not they’re repentant, whether or not they have asked, or whether or not they have remained silent. We cultivate that attitude.\\nThe action of forgiveness is, what Jesus is talking about in Luke 17, where we have someone who has come to us and has asked for forgiveness, and that is when we extend forgiveness. When someone asks to be forgiven when they confess their sin, we say, “Absolutely. I forgive you.” Which action is only possible at a level of depth if we have previously cultivated the attitude of forgiveness in our hearts. When we put these two things together, I think we can conclude that we should be cultivating the attitude of forgiveness in our hearts-whenever we realize that we have something against our brother or sister in Christ who has sinned against us. But I also think that this teaches us that we should not extend that into action until they have asked for forgiveness. So, because we’re cultivating the attitude of —whether it’s because we confront them with it or because someone else does—we would be ready immediately to extend that forgiveness. But we should not extend it until they have asked.\\nI think this is important for two or three reasons. The first reason comes from Ephesians 4:31. It says, “Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and slander be put away from you along with all malice.” This is a command to get rid of bitterness and all the rest that goes along with it and is listed there in Ephesians 4:31. We have to fight bitterness and if we’re not willing to cultivate an attitude of forgiveness, then that is, by definition, a clinging on to bitterness and anger. And that is a sin that will erode our soul, will damage our relationship with the Lord, will damage our own soul, and will damage our relationships with others. And so we need to let go of bitterness. It’s interesting that Ephesians 4:31 goes right into Ephesians 4:32. It says, “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.”\\nThe second reason this is important is because we need to forgive others. This is a command that comes to us throughout the New Testament. We talked about one place at the top of the podcast. Here’s another place in Ephesians 4:32; it’s the command to forgive. But it’s interesting that the command to let go of bitterness, anger, malice, and all the rest precedes the command to forgive. I think what we’ve got here is the cultivation of the attitude of forgiveness is what leads to the extension of the act of forgiveness in relationship. And so the first reason this is important, we need to let go of bitterness. The second reason this is important is that we have to forgive. There’s never an exception to this; we have to forgive all the time. The first one of those leads to the second.\\nBut here’s the third reason this is important, are we need to not undercut the requirement that people who have sinned have to confess. If we have our attitude of forgiveness flow out into an action of forgiveness before that forgiveness has been sought, then we undercut the need of a sinful person to repent of their sin. And that’s not good. That’s why when you watch on the news sometimes, and you’ll see—I just saw this the other day—you’ll see a family saying to a criminal, “I forgive you,” but that person hasn’t said they’re sorry they haven’t even admitted to the crime. To hear, “I forgive you,” makes it irrelevant for the person to confess. Just as true as it is that we have a command to forgive, those who have sinned have a command to confess and repent of their sin from all involved parties, including you, if you’re the one they’ve sinned against. And so, we need to withhold that extension of the action of forgiveness until the person has done what God wants them to do by confessing their sins. So, that is actually a way to serve them and be kind to them and to help them honor God’s law, even as we want to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.\", 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Widening a Closed Heart', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Craig Marshall', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Forgiveness 12', 'question': 'Paul’s love for the Corinthians shows us that our hearts can widen towards others, even in the face of great hurt.', 'body': 'Hurt closes hearts. When someone hurts you deeply your heart that was once warm towards them now feels cold. You longed to see them, to be with them, to share life with them, but now the thought of being around them brings pain, fear of being hurt again, and perplexing questions of why and how they could wound you so badly.\\nAs Christians, we often have a nagging feeling that we’re not “allowed” to just avoid someone who has hurt us for the rest of our lives. We know that we should probably try to treat this other person kindly, at least politely, but does it have to be more than that? Does God really expect that we could once again feel genuine warmth towards them?\\nPerhaps for years a wife has not felt loved by her husband. She consistently thinks that he doesn’t understand her. He seems to disregard her opinions. She continually resolves to be a “good wife” to him and a loving mother to the children, but with each oversight and insult she closes off more and more of her heart to him. She longs for a husband who knows, understands, and loves her; and yet after years of hurt she gives hardly any of herself for him to know and love. She no longer shares her feelings with him. She is willing to care with her hands, but there is nothing left in her heart. Isn’t that enough? Or, does God somehow call her to open up her heart?\\nOr maybe a longtime friend was going through a really hard time. You poured yourself out for him. Long phone calls, meetings over coffee, many shed tears, pleading prayers and carried burdens. Yet one night he tells you it isn’t enough, “You just haven’t really been there for me,” he explains, “I know you’re busy and all, but I’m really going through a lot.” Subtle comments about your inadequacy and questions of your care continue to come and eventually he quits returning your calls. After a few months you learn that he’s attending a different church. You see him in the grocery store or while dropping your kids off at VBS and you feel a coldness of heart. You can smile and be polite, but is it possible that you could really care for him again?\\nPaul’s Hurt\\nThe Apostle Paul was no stranger to relational pain and spurned love. It seems that some were always openly critical of his life and ministry (Philippians 1:17). In 2 Corinthians we find that, despite his deep love for the Corinthians as brothers and sisters in the faith, even they had become influenced by his critics and began to think the worst of his intentions and actions.\\nThe accusations of his critics abounded. He was insincere (1:12; 2:17), lording his authority over his converts (1:24), and tearing others down (7:3a; 10:8b; 13:10). They claimed that he was inferior in knowledge and unskilled as a speaker (10:10; 11:6), his financial requests were suspect (7:2; 12:16), and his apostleship was a sham (12:12; 6:8; 11:13). They implied that he had crafty motives and was taking advantage of people (12:16-17) – even that he was “out of his mind” (5:13). It is hard enough to have someone accuse you of such things, but it’s another thing altogether when even your friends start to believe them. In the face of such misunderstanding and hurt Paul had every reason to close his heart towards the Corinthians.\\nPaul’s Response\\nYet incredibly we see that rather than their coldness pushing Paul away, he grows in warm affection for them and continues to open himself up to them in love.\\n“We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open. You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections. In return (I speak as to children) widen your hearts also” (2 Corinthians 6:11-13).\\nPaul’s love for the Corinthians shows us that our hearts can widen towards others, even in the face of great hurt.\\nHave you been misunderstood, maligned, or accused of selfish intentions when seeking to genuinely love? The Apostle Paul was as well. His example shows us, though, that it does not have to lead to having a callused heart or one guarded in a thick-walled fortress. God is able to work in us in such a way that we can have a heart still “wide open” in love towards those who have pushed us away.\\nThe Call to a Widened Heart\\nPaul not only models this in his actions, but he also commands the Corinthians to do the same. Paul says that they had become “restricted in [their] own affections” (6:12), and he calls them to “widen [their] hearts also.” He reaffirms this idea in 7:2, “Make room in your hearts for us.” He is not merely calling them to “treat him nicely” but instead to widen their affection for him. As a loving father can expect his children to reciprocate that love, so also he calls them to love him like he has loved them (6:13).\\nHas your heart grown cold towards brothers and sisters in Christ? The Apostle’s call is to us as well: God wants to widen our hearts – even towards those who have hurt us. What does this look like? How does this happen?\\nMarks of a Widened Heart\\nThe call to a widened heart can feel ambiguous. We know that the relationship doesn’t feel right, but what it would look like to truly respond in love is not clear to us. Fortunately, Paul’s correspondence with the Corinthians gives us a glimpse of a widened heart. As we look through 2 Corinthians we find three main ways that Paul models genuine love in the face of criticism, mistrust and pain.\\nMoving Towards the Other\\nEven though his encounters with the Corinthians have been painful, Paul continues to express a desire to visit them. Rather than avoiding he seeks to move towards them in person and through his letters.\\n“I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace. I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia…” (2 Corinthians 1:15-16)\\nOur natural tendency is to avoid. We want to pull away in the face of hurt, but love enables us to move towards others even when doing so is not pleasant. Fight this natural tendency by initiating contact with the person who has hurt you. Take the time to ask how they are doing and then really listen. Find out a way you can serve them or invite them to share a meal with you. You may be surprised how far a small gesture can go in restoring the relationship.\\nAffirming Our Love\\nPaul repeatedly affirms his love for the Corinthians, even though their love for him has been lacking.\\n“For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you” (2:4).\\n“I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together…I have great pride in you” (7:2-4).\\nPaul shows us that a widened heart is one that can affirm love in a disproportional way. Click To Tweet\\nWhen someone has spurned our love, our tendency can be to downplay our love for them or to cease offering it. We often only hold out as much love as is being reciprocated. It is scary to offer more love than someone has for us. It’s a vulnerable feeling. It opens us up to rejection and hurt. Yet Paul shows us that a widened heart is one that can affirm love in a disproportional way. He even calls them to love him as he has loved them: “make room in your hearts for us” (7:2). This is a radical, risky request. So go ahead and tell them that you love them. Tell them that you are hurting. Even tell them that you want to make things right but don’t know exactly how to go about it. It is possible that your vulnerability may motivate them to respond in kind.\\nLetting Them In \\nThe candor with which Paul speaks to the Corinthians is striking. He speaks freely with them about what is on his heart – his joys, his sorrows, his struggles (2:1-4; 6:3-10; 7:4).\\n“For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you” (2:4).\\nHis affirmation of his wide heart towards them (6:11) comes immediately after he opens up to them and describes the difficulties of his ministry (6:3-10), explaining to them not only what he did, but how he felt in the midst of it,\\n“We are treated as impostors, and yet are true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything” (6:8-10).\\nAs we seek to rebuild relationship it can be difficult to know what to say. Our conversation becomes relegated to small-talk. Paul shows how wide-open love involves letting the other person in on what is really going on in our hearts. Are there thoughts, feelings, emotions, descriptions of your life that can be shared with them? Willingness to let them in beyond the mere expectations of polite interaction is a sign of a widening heart.\\nThe Making of a Widened Heart\\nWe have seen that we are called to have a widened heart as Paul exemplifies toward the Corinthians. But what enables Paul to respond in this way? How can his heart, rather than shrinking, actually widen in the face of attack? Paul makes it clear that it is “the love of Christ” that motivates and directs his love toward them (5:14). God’s love for him shown in Christ widens his heart in the face of adversity.\\nUltimately our hesitancy to open wide our hearts indicates an inadequate view of God’s heart towards us. His love is not one of action only, as if He has saved us and continues to be kind to us but He does not feel deep affection for us. The salvation that God brings is not merely of position or status, but also of relationship and delight. The Scriptures are filled with images of the Lord’s affection for his people, and yet so often we fail to believe that God’s heart is really moved with love towards us. The battle to have a widened heart is a battle to glimpse the heart of God.\\n“You shall no more be termed Forsaken, and your land shall no more be termed Desolate, but you shall be called My Delight Is in Her, and your land Married; for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married. For as a young man marries a young woman, so shall your sons marry you, and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.” (Isaiah 62:4-5)\\nThe “breadth and length and height and depth” of God’s love shown to us in Christ expands a heart shrunken by years of neglect (Ephesians 3:18). It warms a heart grown cold by repeated hurt. His grace makes us people whose hearts widen when they should naturally close, and this gospel-empowered response points others towards the unfathomable dimensions of His redemptive love.\\nHas your heart grown cold towards a brother or sister in Christ because of how they have hurt you? Allow Paul’s call to the Corinthians to “open wide your heart also” to be yours as you consider your relationship with this person. Pray that the Lord will warm your heart with his love for you and give you the ability to overflow in love towards them. Prayerfully consider what it would look like to take steps towards a widened heart – moving towards them, affirming your love, and letting them into what is really going on in your life and heart. Seek counsel from others about what this could appropriately look like. And then pray that the love of Christ would compel you to be able to take steps of faith in opening wide your heart to them as the Lord gives you opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCraig Marshall is the Director of Operations/Trainer for The Institute for Biblical Counseling and Discipleship (IBCD).

But then you’ve got a text like\\xa0Luke 17:3-4\\xa0where Jesus also says, “Be on your guard if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him and if he sins against you seven times a day and returns to you seven times a day saying I repent forgive him.” So you have these two teachings of Jesus. Jesus on the one hand saying, if you’re standing there praying and you realize there’s a problem with your brother then forgive him so that you will be heard in your prayers. And then you’ve got this statement of Jesus that says forgive your brother when he repents. And so how do we solve this apparent dilemma?\\nI think it helps us to think in two categories. I think we can think of forgiveness, on the one hand, as an action that transpires in relationship. And we can think of forgiveness, on the other hand, as an attitude that we cultivate in our soul. Jesus in Mark 11\\xa0is talking about forgiveness as an attitude that we cultivate in our soul. When he says if you’re standing there praying forgive. He’s saying release that person from your anger, from your bitterness, from the penalty of your sin right there. He’s talking about cultivating an action in our heart. We might say that it is the willingness to extend forgiveness. But we settle the matter in our heart whether or not they are sorry, whether or not they are repentant, whether or not they have asked, or whether or not they have remained silent. We cultivate that attitude.\\nThe action of forgiveness is what Jesus is talking about in Luke 17\\xa0where we have someone who has come to us and has asked for forgiveness and that is when we extend forgiveness, when someone asks for forgiveness, when they confess their sin we say, “Absolutely. I forgive you,” which action is only possible at the level of depth if we have previously cultivated the attitude of forgiveness in our heart. When we put these two things together I think we can conclude this: that we should be cultivating the attitude of forgiveness in our heart whenever we realize that we have something against our brother or sister in Christ who has sinned against us. But I also think that this teaches us that we should not extend that into an action until they have asked for forgiveness. Because we’re cultivating the attitude of forgiveness whenever they would ask for forgiveness, whenever they would express brokenness over their sin whether its because we confront them with it or whether its because someone else does, we would be ready immediately to extend that forgiveness but we should not extend it until they have asked. I think this is important for two or three reasons.\\nThe first reason comes from\\xa0Ephesians 4:31, it says, “Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you along with all malice.” This is a command to get rid of bitterness and all the rest that goes along and is listed there in\\xa0Ephesians 4:31. We have to fight bitterness and if we’re not willing to cultivate an attitude of forgiveness than that is by definition a clinging on to bitterness and anger and that is a sin that will erode our soul, will damage our relationship with the Lord, will damage our own soul, and will damage our relationships with others. And so we need to let go of bitterness. Its interesting that\\xa0Ephesians 4:31\\xa0goes right into\\xa0Ephesians 4:32\\xa0and it says, “Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other just as God and Christ also has forgiven you.” The second reason this is important is because we need to forgive others. This is a command that comes to us throughout the New Testament.\\nHere’s another place in\\xa0Ephesians 4:32. Its the command to forgive but its interesting that the command to let go of bitterness and anger and malice and all the rest precedes the command to forgive. I think what we’ve got here is the cultivation of the attitude of forgiveness is what leads to the extension of the act of forgiveness in relationship. And so the first reason this is important: we need to let go of bitterness.\\nSecond reason this is important is because we have to forgive. There’s never an exception to this. We have to forgive all the time and the first one of those leads to the second. But here’s the third reason this is important. We need to not undercut the requirement that people who have sinned have to confess. If we have our attitude of forgiveness flow out into an action of forgiveness before that forgiveness has been sought then we undercut the need of a sinful person to repent of their sin and that’s not good. That’s why when you watch on the news sometimes and you’ll see, and I just saw this the other day, you’ll see a family saying to a criminal, “I forgive you,” but that person hasn’t said they’re sorry, they haven’t even admitted to the crime. To hear, “I forgive you,” makes it irrelevant for the person to confess. Just as true as it is that we have a command to forgive those who have sinned have a command to confess and repent of their sin from all involved parties, including you if you’re the one they’ve sinned against. And so we need to withhold that extension of the action of forgiveness until the person has done what God wants them to do by confessing their sin. So that is actually a way to serve them and to be kind to them and to help them honor God’s law even as we want it.\\nIf you’d like more information about this topic you can read a book by Robert Jones, a counselor certified by ACBC, called “Pursuing Peace,” where he deals with this topic in very helpful detail. And you can also read Heath Lambert’s book, “A Theology of Biblical Counseling,” where he addresses this issue of forgiveness in the chapter on the theology of sin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nForgiveness\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmy Evenson is the Executive Assistant to Dr. Heath Lambert at\\xa0First Baptist Church\\xa0in\\xa0Jacksonville, Florida.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

How does this relate to the sin of partiality?', 'body': 'Dale Johnson: This week on the podcast, I’m delighted to have with me a dear friend, Virgil Walker. He serves as the Executive Director of Operations for G3 Ministries. Virgil served as the discipleship pastor at Westside Church in Omaha, Nebraska for six years, and is the co-host of The Just Thinking Podcast. And so, what a great thing to have him with us. Virgil and I go way back quite a few years, teaching biblical counseling up at Omaha. Got to know this brother and his love for the Scriptures, his love for biblical counseling and soul care, and his love for God’s church. I’m looking forward to the time that we’re going to be spending together, coming up here real soon, October 3rd through the 5th on our conference, created In His Image. And I want you to be with us there in Memphis. There’s still time to sign up. So, make sure that you avail yourself of that. \\nI want to mention something that’s really important, Virgil before we get into this whole, talk about the sin of partiality, this is something that’s dominated the news for several years now, and we need to have biblical clarity on this. And honestly, there are three primary things, I think are so critical for us to speak into in our world. Number one, ecclesiology. We have to get a right understanding of God’s Church, there’s no plan B and we have to do this well according to Scripture. The second thing is this issue of the sufficiency of the Bible. We’ve got to get clarity on the extent of the Bible. We seem to be short arming ourselves thinking of authority, but often lacking in sufficiency. And we’re not only to hear the Word to have intellectual assent to authority, we are to do the Word, which demonstrates that we believe in sufficiency, that it is authoritative over on our life, practically. And then, part of what we want to talk about today and the sin of partiality is anthropology. There’s not been a more damaging place that I’ve seen psychology infiltrate than a biblical understanding of man, it’s radically altered the way we think about it. And here’s the thing downstream Virgil, what we see is partiality and issues like this, where we see the destruction of biblical understanding of man, and then we try to respond in ways that are that are different than what the Scripture tells us to respond.\\nSo, first of all, welcome to the podcast. I did a little longer intro there, but I’m so grateful that you’re here, brother, and our relationship. I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you and growing in our friendship and I’m so grateful that you’re here.\\xa0\\nVirgil Walker: Glad to be here, man, excited for what we’re going to jump into today.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Alright, so we’re just going to jump in. Okay? Why is having a biblical anthropology important in the church?\\nVirgil Walker: Yeah,\\xa0I think it’s important for a variety of reasons. Let’s start with what’s happening in culture. When we look around the landscape of culture, what we see is a lack of understanding of who man is, right? There’s questions everywhere. Is a man really a man? Can a man be a woman? And can a woman be a man? So, you’re dealing with issues around gender and sexuality, whether it’s the issue of sexuality with homosexuality, and what kinds of things should be allowed. And what flavor of sin am I into this week, right? And so, you got all those issues and then compound upon that, it’s like a yin and yang. If at one point, we’re not dealing with gender issues, on the other end, we’re dealing with race, right, and ethnicity. And it’s as if like, you know, you’ve got two years or three years of really, a push with the agenda of the LGBTQ. And then, once that kind of wanes a bit, then you have the issue with ethnicity, people of color, and all this segmentation that’s happening, as cultures is reeling with that, unfortunately, because of a lack of what you just mentioned, biblical sufficiency, biblical authority and really Scripture being preached in an exposition way from the pulpit, what we’re seeing happen is those same ideas about who we are as human beings are infiltrating the church. So, what you end up seeing is you see churches wrestling with do I embrace the LGBTQ? Do we open the doors? We need to be more caring, more loving and so, pragmatic approaches begin to really show themselves where there’s a lack of real biblical clarity on these issues.\\nThe same is true that we’ve witnessed with regard to social justice. The idea is everybody’s for justice, who’s not for justice? Who’s not in favor of someone experiencing something right rather than something wrong? Well, when we add on to it the idea of social justice, we’re walking away from what God designed as righteousness and the meaning of justice, and now we’ve attached to it our own political proclivities that come alongside that. So, now what we’re advocating for is rather than that which is right from wrong, what we’re advocating for is, we’re advocating for government to intervene in situations in an effort to empower one group at the subjugation of another.\\nSo, all of this creates chaos, absolute chaos culturally speaking, and then, once it invades the church, we really have no thought process about how to address, how do we deal with this? How do we do it? And again, I mean we could, this one question, bro, we could spend a lot of time on because of the pragmatic approaches that have been that have invaded the church, and the sentimentalism that is attached to the pragmatism that’s happening in the church.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now, I want to get to that, and talk about how this has invaded the church. One important step that we need to cover first is the implication of some of the things that you just described, okay. Some of the implications that we’re describing here is that if we have a different view of anthropology, we treat people differently based on some other system. Social justice in and of itself is a sociological framework. So, now we’re appealing to something else by that qualifier. Now in order to measure what is just and what is not.\\nThe Scripture makes very clear in Hebrews 5:14, that what it means to be discerning, what it means to be mature is that our powers of discernment are strengthened by us understanding what’s good and evil from God’s perspective, that’s a definition of maturity. And so, if we’re not measuring justice from God’s perspective, then we have a short-sighted view of what is truly just. We may get some things right that are consistent with biblical principles and God’s perspective, but the aim is going to be something radically different. And we have to pay attention to the confusion that this is contributing to in the society in which we live, and into the church that we live in right now and so, we have to bring clarity that these things are not benign. These things matter because the implications, if we don’t stand fast on biblical truth is the practice then starts to lead us away from that foundation of God’s declaration of good and evil. Now, we get to talking about this issue of how has this invaded the church? Okay, so the question is, how? And then, I want us to sort of flesh that out as to, what are the implications in the ways that the church has impacted, as we think about this ideology invading the church?\\nVirgil Walker: Well again, I think it started long ago. I’ve always argued that most will look at two kinds of lynch points. The Obergefell decision with regard to the LGBTQ issues. And then, they’ll look at with regard to social justice, kind of what just happened in 2020 with the George Floyd issue. So, they’ll look at those two flashpoints, and I would argue that all those did, was it exposed what was going on long before, which really if you go back and begin looking at what was happening in evangelicalism was the embrace of a more pragmatic approach to everything that we did related to ecclesiology.\\nYou mentioned it earlier the idea that you know what we need to have more sermons that are more focused on topics rather than really pulling from the Scripture, the idea that we’ve got to figure out how to woo the culture into the church rather than recognizing that the church is to be those who are called out by Christ to come into the family of God, by faith through repentance. When we do those things and look at church growth processes and practices, we begin to walk away from the sufficiency of Scripture. Our thought process is, you know what, Scripture was good, but it’s kind of old-timey, it’s kind of old-timey. So, we need to try something new, and our approach is probably the better one. God really didn’t have this thing down like we’ve got it down today, so we’ve got to do something different. And as we do that, what begins to happen? Pragmatism takes hold, we’re practicing those things that we think are going to woo people in, and then you add to that sentimentality, you hear that in every worship song, you hear that in how we sing to God, how we sing about God. And then, those approaches about how we view God have the tendency to focus on how we view one another. So, now the person with the saddest story, with the confused background with issues that they’ve struggled with during their childhood, they’re raised to the fore rather than recognizing all of us are sinners before a holy God and our need of repentance and faith in Christ.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Well, that sentimentality begins to reshape a morality that our consciences are built on, and then emotionalism becomes a part of that. Because you know, we’ve now breached that standard of morality that’s built upon sentimentality, you talk about ecclesiology and what we’re appealing to. Listen, guys, this is how anthropology matters is because when we redefine\\xa0anthropology in such a way that it changes the man or the woman that we think we’re trying to reach in the church, we now start appealing to the flesh, and here’s the deal right? And Virgil, you know this, when we appeal to the flesh, we are running a fool’s errand to expect spiritual results, but yet it comes down to the definition of what we think the church is actually for. Is the church for proclaiming the truth and us conforming to God? Or are we going to dismiss the standard that God grants and try to conform Him to us, right? Those are our options, right?\\nSo, when we talk about this issue, don’t miss the foundational aspects of anthropology that are rooted in center point here, and we have to cover this because some people are looking at this and being very, very confused. Like why is this happening? How did this happen? We see this happening in multiple areas. Our topic today is the sin of partiality and the way it affects us, race and how we view things like that, social justice. But this is happening across the board relative to complementarity, sexuality, sexual identity, those sorts of things, even authority, pastoral authority, those sorts of things. And we’re seeing a similar trend ideologically where we’re divorcing ourselves from those good social orders that God has granted to us.\\nAnd so, what I want to do now is take all of this stuff people are probably very familiar with your Just Thinking Podcast and some of the things that you and Darrell Harrison developed on that podcast. We’ve recommended it here, just for clarity on some of these issues because there’s so much confusion. What I want to do now, Virgil is just to give you an opportunity to really hone in and talk to that pastor who’s out in the middle of serving a church faithfully, his people are all over the map. They don’t know how to deal with this. They’re confused, they see good in people wanting justice. Like, isn’t that biblical? This is good. So, I want to just be very pointed in this question. How should a pastor handle some of the challenges of the culture that we’re experiencing right now with issues, just like social justice and CRT?\\nVirgil Walker: Yeah, my short answer is trust the gospel to do its work. That’s my short answer, but what happens is and I wanted to speak with specificity to how this what this looks like in a local church, more times than not what it doesn’t look like it. Probably those who are listening to your podcast to this information here, they hadn’t gone woke. These aren’t people who are out marching with Black Lives Matter folk, right, they understand that, hey, that’s a different ideological framework. But perhaps, they’re in their own setting looking around and seeing a bunch of white faces and feeling a lot of guilt about that, right? They’re thinking, man, there’s got to be some more people of color that can be a part of the church here, and what can we do to switch our, maybe we’ll change up the music a little bit. Maybe we’ll sing this way and do certain things this way. And I would argue that God knows who He’s calling to be a part of His church, right? When we look at Scripture, we identify that at the end of it all in Revelation, what do we see? Every tribe, tongue, and nation is before the Lamb of God, right? So, if we trust that to be true, what we do is what we’ve been called to do, which is go out and proclaim the gospel and do so without any thought process to partiality of any kind. Preach to everyone, in every way, shape, and form, and allow the gospel to do the work of drawing men unto Himself. That’s what it’s designed to do.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: That’s exactly right. I think that’s a good anchoring word for us because the Bible tells us in Hebrews 6:19 that it is this confession of Christ, the Gospel of which you speak, Virgil, that is the anchor of our souls in really tough, and turbulent times, like what we see right now.\\nI want to bring this down to talk about partiality itself, okay? we understand right there are evil actors in the world. Some of the things that people utilize to talk about racial divides, ethnic tensions, and these sorts of things, some of those things are absolutely real, there are evil actors, and when we see the gospel not present, bringing peace. We see divisions across all kinds of socio-economic classes, ethnicities, and so on, but we have to be cautious when we’re thinking about this issue of partiality.\\nI want you to help us to understand how are these things presented, right? The sins of partiality, because we want to correct those. That is God’s justice. That is how we see the gospel bring peace and erase those divides. I want to see churches where the explanation of those people being together whatever in the world they should be divided on, is the explanation of the Gospel. So, how do we number one, recognize legitimate sins of partiality, and then how do we start moving in a direction where the Gospel starts to help us?\\xa0\\nVirgil Walker: Yeah, one of the things, I think we’ve got to recognize with regard to the sin of partiality when we’re looking for it, right? We’re out there, we’re examining the world in which we live. We’re looking for, we should be shocked if we understand the true nature of sin that we don’t see it more often than we do. So, I think we’ve got to first begin there, man, we should see a whole lot more of this than we actually do. God’s hand is actually with us, as far as the people of God, I’m talking about the church as it pertains to local assembly. We should see more of this than we do. Thank God, we don’t. But when we do, we’ve got, we’ve got a Bible that tells us how to deal with this. And what we do regarding the sin of partiality, what we end up doing because of the cultural narrative is we’re looking for partiality between black and white, partiality between the have’s and the have not’s. We’ve got markers now, the oppressed and the oppressor, right? That’s Marxian, you know, ideology.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Men and women. Those who defend feminism.\\nVirgil Walker: Absolutely, absolutely. So, you got all of these things and I think there’s wisdom when looking at when brothers and sisters sin against one another. I think we need to eradicate race-ism, right? And by that, what I mean, is stop using that terminology altogether. Because at the end of the day, if you hate me because of the color of my skin, at the end of the day that sin is hatred, and as a result, if you have hatred in your heart against me, you are a murderer, right? Scripture says it, Scripture calls it that way.\\nSo, let’s address it not from an “ism”, what we’re doing when we add the “ism” onto it is we’re trying to speak to motivation. What motivated you to hate me rather than recognizing that’s the sin of hatred. And as a result of that, we need to deal with that biblically by calling that sin what it is, it’s sin, and commanding those to repent of that sin. This isn’t rocket science. This really isn’t that difficult if we stick to biblical anthropology that we’re created in the image of God that He made from one man, every ethnos, every nation right under heaven. So, we know that we recognize that we’re no different than one another, we’re all image bearers who are filled with sin and need to repent of that sin and place our full faith in Jesus Christ.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah absolutely. And do you guys, do you hear the simplicity? That God really puts it on a shelf where we can grasp it, and any time we start making things more sophisticated than what they need to be, what you’re describing here, Virgil is if we call these things an “ism”, then we create a new path to remedy of these things, and then Colossians 2:23 makes very clear. When we try to utilize those types of self-made wisdom, human wisdom to wrangle the flesh. The Bible says, it is of no value in overcoming the powers of the flesh, and the indulgences of the flesh.\\nAnd so, yeah, we have to be very cautious here when we categorize it appropriately and you’re not running from it, you’re not sweeping it under the rug, you’re not saying this isn’t a manifestation of sin in our heart, we’re acknowledging that. But when we determine this to be sin as God defines it, now, there’s a remedy to what we can see legitimate change. And that’s what we’re after.\\nWell, listen, this has been a really great conversation and I’m so grateful for Virgil, and our friendship over the years. I knew him before he was famous, truthfully. I love this brother. We’ve had a lot of good conversations and I just appreciated his wisdom over the years, as we’ve batted back and forth ideas. And I hope you’ve enjoyed just getting to sit in on what some of those conversations would be like, as we’ve enjoyed short, fun moments together. And so listen, I want to finish by saying come to our conference. Virgil’s going to be with us. He’s going to be one of our plenary speakers. He’s going to be talking about this issue at more lengths, the sin of partiality.\\n\\nFind out more information about ACBC’s 2022 Annual Conference, In His Image. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

Relational strife can quickly degenerate into a battle of he said, she said arguments. Accusations are lobbed back and forth, tempers flare, and nothing is accomplished.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIndividuals in conflict, however, can prepare for success by making these four commitments before attempting to discuss any specific problem. Making these promises first will increase the likelihood that the relationship will be reconciled, and God will be honored.\\xa0\\xa0\\n1. I Will Examine Myself First.\\nAsk yourself: Is there any possibility I could be at fault? Is there any possibility I could be deceived? Could I be wrong? \\nI remember the first time that idea even occurred to me. I was waxing eloquent about some situation in my life and how angry I was at the people involved. My sister, a more mature believer than I, looked at me and calmly asked, “What if you’re wrong?” I was shocked; that thought had not occurred to me.\\xa0\\nAdmitting you may not have it all right is the first step to having godly, growing relationships. Jesus said if you don’t examine yourself first you cannot even see clearly (Matthew 7:3-5). It’s normal to believe you are correct in your thinking; after all, most likely yours is the only perspective you have. But did you know you can be certain you are right but, in fact, be wrong (Proverbs 14:12; 16:25)? Have you considered that you can even be right and still be wrong because of the way you handle a situation? The Scriptures are clear that if you truly want God to direct your path, you must not trust your own heart (Proverbs 3:5-6). It takes humility to admit your viewpoint may be a little bit skewed or even totally incorrect.\\xa0\\nIf you cannot agree that there may be something you could learn, repent of, and change, there is no use in even looking for help. God’s Word does not speak highly of the person who will not listen to counsel (Proverbs 12:15). First Samuel 25 describes a foolish man named Nabal who was harsh (v.3), and no one can speak to him (v. 17). I would assume people tried to speak to Nabal, but he would not hear them. Nobody can speak to, and certainly cannot help someone who will not hear. If you won’t acknowledge that you may not have the right perspective, the discussions you have will resemble a hamster on a wheel that goes round and round: much energy is expended, but there will be no progress. Stay off the wheel and admit, I could be wrong; I may be deceived. Perhaps I am the one who needs to repent of my wrong thinking and actions.\\xa0\\n2. I Will Silence the Inner Lawyer.1Paul Tripp develops the concept of the Inner Lawyer in his book, Dangerous Calling: Confronting the Unique Challenges of Pastoral Ministry, (Wheaton, IL, Crossway, 2012).\\xa0\\xa0\\nProverbs 21:2 tells us that every way of man is right in his own eyes. Everyone has an inner lawyer who is relentless in his job of being right and proving his own innocence. Good lawyers protect their clients; their goal is to frame the evidence in such a way that their client (themself) is declared not guilty. Inner lawyers defend and justify sinful behavior. They often say something like this:\\xa0\\xa0\\nI did curse at her because she was disrespectful (lazy, incompetent, yelling at me first, not meeting my needs, etc.)\\xa0I did disrespect him, because he deserved it (he was mean to me first, disrespectful, argumentative, not being loving, not meeting my needs).\\xa0I did talk to all my friends about how bad he is, because I had to have help and prayer support.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe purpose of counseling is not to declare a winner or loser by weighing the evidence to determine who is the greatest offender. When the inner lawyer emerges, the counseling room becomes the courtroom, where people are defending their own innocence and pronouncing the other party guilty. Even the Apostle Paul declared that his own clear conscience didn’t prove he was right (1 Corinthians 4:4). Resist the temptation to defend yourself. Your Inner lawyer must be silenced.\\xa0\\n3. I Will Embrace the Goal.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nGod’s Word tells us that conflict does not come from the other person you are fighting with.\\xa0On the contrary, conflict comes from you.\\xa0It comes directly from the things you want. James 4:1-3 tells us that quarrels and fights come from the things you want badly that are having a war inside of you. What you say and do comes directly from your strong desires. The purpose of counseling is not to fix the other person so you can have what you want: a happier marriage, a more comfortable life, a more obedient child, and a more loving friend or spouse. The goal is not to prove to the other person that they need to change so you can get what you want and have a better life.\\xa0\\xa0\\nProfitable conversations cannot even begin unless both parties resolve that they want to please God more than getting what they want. As Ken Collier of the Wilds Christian Camp so aptly states, Just two choices on the shelf, pleasing God or pleasing self.2K Collier, The Wilds Christian Camp, https://wilds.org. If both parties in conflict will embrace the goal of pleasing God above themselves, full reconciliation is certain.3Robert D. Jones, Pursuing Peace, (Wheaton, IL, Crossway, 2012), p. 52. Both must determine to honor the Lord first (2 Corinthians 5:9). If not, the discussion will quickly end up back on the hamster wheel. \\nEmbrace the goal: I will please God first.\\xa0\\n4. I Will Resist the Inner Pharisee.\\nJust as we all have an Inner Lawyer, we also have a pharisee that lives in our hearts (Luke 18:9-14). How do you know when your Inner Pharisee rears his ugly head? You will say (or think in your heart) something like this: I’m glad I’m not like them. At least I work hard, go to church, keep the house clean, keep my body fit, etc.). This pharisee loves the word but. He will declare, I know I (fill in the blank), but at least I don’t (fill in the blank). The word but serves to prop up his own righteousness by minimizing his own faults and focusing on those of the other person:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI know I yell at her, but at least I don’t take out my anger on the children like she does.\\xa0I know I give him the silent treatment, but at least I don’t sit in front of the TV like he does every night.\\xa0I know I have trouble controlling my anger, but at least I don’t clam up and refuse to talk like she does.\\xa0\\xa0\\nInner Pharisees consider themselves to be righteous and treat others with contempt (Luke 18:9). Do you sense that an Inner Pharisee is alive in your heart? He will be relentless, so resist him by God’s grace.\\xa0\\nAre you seeking help for your relational conflict? Do your own pre-counseling first by admitting you could be at fault, silencing the Inner Lawyer, committing to the goal of pleasing Christ above all else, and resisting that Inner Pharisee. If you do, you will be way ahead – or maybe even at the end of the road to success in solving your conflict.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGretchen Fant is a pastor’s wife, an ACBC certified member, and has been counseling for over 20 years.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

I’m so grateful for her and her work. Aurelia, first of all, I want to welcome you to the podcast and I want to say a word or two about you. So, welcome to the podcast. I’m so glad that you are with us and you’re an engaged member at ACBC, and you serve your local church well. So, thank you so much for being with us.\\xa0\\nAurelia Smith: Well, thank you so much. It’s a delight to be with you today.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I want to tell you a little bit about Miss Aurelia. She did her undergraduate degree at the Air Force Academy and she completed her MABC at The Master’s University. She has been an ACBC member since 2010. If all that education was not difficult enough, she’s now engaged in a pre-med degree program and has some aspirations to pursue medical school and that sort of thing. I love hanging out with Aurelia. She has just a clear-headed, kind perspective on things. She has written a book I’m going to mention to you, Ministering to Military Women. \\nAurelia, I’m so grateful that you’re here. We’re going to talk a little bit about a breakout session that you gave at our most recent Annual Conference back in October of 2021. It’s on this topic, Grace Relations: Counseling Using the Psalms of Lament, Prayers, and Supplication for the Majority and Minority Culture Christians. Listen, we don’t have to tap dance around the difficulties that we see with race relations and that sort of thing. I appreciate so much that you’re willing to talk about these difficult issues. I want to start by just saying, you know, what are some of the things that prompted you to discuss this topic?\\xa0\\nAurelia Smith: Well, yes, thank you so much, and that was quite a mouthful for that title so I’m glad you truncated it to just Grace Relations. At any rate, it’s sort of multi-pronged that covers both the past and the present. You know, in the past, I’ve had some personal experiences growing up. My father was in the military. I went to three different high schools, just as an example, one in California, one overseas in Germany, and then I moved in the middle of my senior year to Louisiana. So, even with that, in the middle of my senior year, I just had some brushes with some ethnic hatred, you know, right there in the middle of the Bible belt. So that’s part of my story. Also, there have been some hard realities in the church that I and my family members within the last two to three years have faced, so that’s part of what prompts me to talk about it, then just a desire to facilitate safe spaces amongst the body of believers where real conversations about culture and ethnicity can be met with love, respect, and grace. \\nThat’s something that really is prompting my heart and I want to help believers and counselors to answer the question, how do you minister to the person in front of you who’s hurting from an ethnic or cultural incident in your church family? So, really go on a personal scale.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I love that, and I think it’s helpful in a thousand directions because this is more common than we probably wish to admit. These things sometimes happen incidentally. Sometimes they are intentional exclusions, or whatever the case might be, and just not living with each other in an understanding way. You talk about this issue of “grace relations.” What is this idea? What is grace relations counseling, and what have you seen that has made it an important part of the counseling process?\\xa0\\nAurelia Smith: Absolutely. Well, first, I want to give credit where credit is due because I did not coin that term, grace relations. It was actually coined by Dr. Charles Ware in the updated book he co-authored with Ken Ham which is called, One Race, One Blood: The Biblical Answer to Racism. So GRACE is actually an acronym that stands for God’s Reconciliation At Christ’s Expense. I prefer to use this phrase rather than race since race is highly problematic, right? There’s only one race, the human race. So I really appreciate this term grace relations. Although their book isn’t about counseling, I’m applying it to the counseling context because it attempts to deal with the sins of the past and alienation of the present in redemptive waves that are built on forgiveness, peace, unity, and love, and it reminds us all to put away unrighteous anger and the polarization that’s prevalent today among God’s people. \\nSo, all of this is super important because we know from the Scriptures, seeing God’s heart revealed all the way from Genesis all the way to Revelation, to the new Heaven and new earth, He has got this desire for kingdom diversity and kingdom unity. It’s important because of Jesus’ words both in John 13 and 17. He made it clear that our love and unity as believers would enable the lost world to believe that Jesus was sent by God and that we would be shown to be His disciples. Then finally, there’s been a command expressed that we weep with those who weep in Romans 12, and we can’t obey this command without work, effort, or awareness on one side, and on the other side, others can’t weep with us if we are unwilling to be appropriately transparent and take the risk of sharing what we have faced and are facing. So those are some of the reasons why they’re important.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: That’s great. I love the way that you’re describing, the answers are rooted not in more division based on skin color and that sort of thing. Understanding, from a biblical perspective, we are one race and because of sin we see that division happening, and we are a part of what needs to correct this issue in the church. \\nNow, I want to sort of lead that into maybe another question. Why do you believe the church–especially biblical counselors, because we’re sort of on the ground level of dealing with people’s problems–but the church specifically. Why do you believe the church and biblical counselors are poised to offer true and redemptive solutions to cultural and ethnic tension among God’s people, and particularly giving answer to the world at large? This is not only a church problem. This is what we see reflected in the church because we see it as a problem in the world that we live in. So give us some understanding about the church and biblical counselors, why we are probably best suited to address these issues.\\nAurelia Smith: Well, you know, the church has the sufficient Scriptures, number one. The church has a sure hope and a clear understanding of what redemption is all about through the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Believers in the church are empowered by the Holy Spirit to tackle recalcitrant problems in a way that’s winsome, grace-filled, and loving to the glory of God, so much so that a hurting world stands up and takes notice. Then one of my favorite quotes by John Perkins states, “There is no institution on earth more equipped or more capable of bringing transformation to the cause of reconciliation than the church.” I wholeheartedly agree with him. However, I also believe biblical counselors are especially fit to be unifiers in this area because we’ve been trained to listen well. We’ve been trained on how to use wise questions. We’ve been trained about how to develop real relationships with the people we’re walking alongside. We’ve been trained about how to be compassionate servants to hurting souls. \\nWhen I went through the MABC program a couple of years ago, one of the ways they taught the biblical counseling process was through the “Eight I’s.” Those eight “I’s” are involvement, inspiration, inventory, instruction, inducement, implementation, and integration. That first part, involvement, is absolutely key in this discussion because it’s based on the foundations of compassion, respect, and sincerity. It avoids presumptive suspicion and it never minimizes the problem presented by our counselee. These are traits that are often sorely lacking in discussions about ethnic tension, both outside and inside the church today. God can use us as biblical counselors in an amazing way to bring hope, healing, unity, and light in the midst of a lot of pain. So this whole idea really makes me excited.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, absolutely, and the gospel gives the proper context by which we are to understand these types of tensions, right? It’s not seeing through color-stained lenses, seeing each other that way, but helping us to see each other through the lens of the gospel in the way that God sees one humanity. That’s something that’s so needed in the church, particularly today. You think about the ways the church ought to be impacting the culture rather than us seeing the culture bleed into the church. We have an opportunity here because of the powerful gospel that God has given us in his Word. Man, I’m grateful that you’re talking through this. Let me ask you a couple of other questions that I think would help us. I mentioned the Psalms of lament, so I want to get to that here in a second, but what are some of the scenarios that biblical counselors might face and want to think about beforehand to respond in a wise and Christ-honoring way? This is something that’s important for biblical counselors. We want to be culturally informed. We want to know what’s going on. We don’t adapt truth to the culture, right? I mean, we take truth and we speak truth into culture, but in order to speak it effectively, we have to know how the culture thinks. It’s important that we do this well. So what are some of the things the biblical counselor might want to be prepared for in these contexts?\\xa0\\nAurelia Smith: Right. In order to answer that question, I actually went through what I went through in the seminar, the breakout session at the conference, and I gave them four different scenarios to help them think through what they might see. At first, it may sound like, wow, that’s got to be far-fetched, but I assure you these are actually things that have happened recently. \\nSo the first scenario that I used revolved around a newcomer of Hispanic descent visiting your church. He was excited because he knew about your commitment to expository preaching and even the Hispanic ministry you had, however, he noticed that several people kept their distance from him during the meet and greet time. He also overheard a congregate saying, I wonder if he’s legal. So what I did was, I read this scenario, talked through and asked them, the people who were present, just to think through how they might respond. Also, afterward, we started to talk about—What do you think this person might be feeling? What do you think they might be thinking?—so that they could start to identify with that person. So, that’s scenario one. \\nScenario two had to do with a young couple about to get married. Both of them are faithful followers of Christ. The young man is black and the young woman is white. Longtime friends in the church began to voice their doubts and prejudices, and believe them to be “unequally yoked.” I’m using air quotes there around that. So once again, posing the question of, if someone comes to you with this type of hurt, how would you as a counselor respond? What do you think they’re thinking and feeling? \\nThe third scenario revolved around a white man who grew up in an inner-city environment and he attempted to engage a minority brother in his church family and was accused of racism after he tried to ask a well-intentioned question. So, something that we see can be going on today as well. \\nThen the last scenario was about how a minority member of your congregation comes to talk after experiencing several events in the church and the community at large in which her and her family feel like the other or outsiders. She explains that when she cautiously tried to share with her majority culture friend, she was offended and warned her against being a social justice warrior and to not propagate CRT. So these are some very present, real scenarios that I put before you.\\nDale Johnson: No, I think that’s helpful, and these are real discussions that are happening all around us in different cases, particularly where you are. I grew up in the south. These are certainly cases that happen and have happened. We are positioned well, certainly, not to adopt a framework of Critical Race Theory or anything like that. The gospel gives better expression to our experiences and we have to deal with those, even the divisions that are created by the culture in which we live. That’s certainly what we see happening to us right now. I love the way that you’re describing this by grace relations. It’s having grace when we interact with one another and knowing that there are certain, you know, potential fears or the backdrop of their life story of things that they’ve gone through, and just being patient with one another and being grace-filled as we interact with one another. \\nNow, I do want to get to the Psalms of lament because we talked about that in the title. Can you explain why the Psalms of lament can be a loving and wise place to start if someone comes to you who has been hurt by some sort of ethnically charged event in a local church setting? Explain just a little bit about the importance of the Psalms of lament and how you use them when you talk about grace relations.\\xa0\\nAurelia Smith: Well, the Psalms of lament help us to vocalize pain, grief, or fear in a way that turns us towards God with our pain, in faith, while choosing to trust that He’ll ultimately deliver and for the final outcome. So, the beautiful thing is that we don’t have to understand all the nuances of the pain of the person who’s weeping, or we also don’t have to have the same experience of the person who’s struggling in order to respond with this type of compassion. It merely requires that we would be willing to enter into their sorrows in a loving, redemptive, compassionate way. So that’s why I find them so powerful. In all of the scenarios we just discussed, I talked about how we would build a bridge as counselors using specific passages from both personal and corporate Psalms of Lament. The ones that I used in particular to address those scenarios that I spoke about in a very abbreviated form today, here on the podcast, were in Psalm 42, 54, 55, 56, 86, 123, and 142. \\nFor instance, in that second scenario that I talked to you about, people bringing up this couple being unequally yoked, I used Psalm 55:12-22, different portions, to really hit on this. I want to read just little portions of that to really bring it into focus here. It says, “For it is not an enemy who taunts me–then I could bear it. It is not an adversary who deals insolently with me–then I could hide from him. But it is you, a man, my equal, my companion, my familiar friend. We used to take sweet counsel together within God’s house; we walked in the throng…But I call to God, and the Lord will save me. Evening and morning and at noon I utter my complaint moan, and he hears my voice. He redeems my soul in safety from the battle wage, for many are arrayed against me” Then it talks about casting your burden on the Lord. He will sustain you. He will never permit the righteous to be moved. It’s just so beautiful when you think of what that person might be feeling, or experiencing, that the Scriptures in such a profound way give voice, right, to those heart cries. So to see those ancient words that are right in line with what they’re feeling today points again to the sufficiency of Scripture, and to a compassionate God who understands what their burdens are and He carries them close.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I love that. The beauty of the Psalms of Lament is it points us in the right direction. Yes, we’re not dismissing that we’re having, what I call, sociological problems. We are having those. Those are tensions between people, but the reality is, even in the New Testament, we’re told our battle is not against flesh and blood. We are to cast our cares upon the Lord, and the beauty of the Psalms of Lament is, they help us to do that well. They make our aim toward God, God being the answer to our questions, our most deep and valued questions, or being the answer to the deepest anguishes that we have. I think that’s extremely appropriate. \\nNow, I like the way in some of this that you balance the idea that it’s not only lament that we’re doing, right? We’re not just only weeping with those who weep and that’s the part that’s “therapeutic.” That’s important, right? It does help to bring healing and identification with the person and, you know, all of that stuff which God tells us to, and compassion to respond to each other, but why can we not just tarry with lament? It can’t be the totality of our response, right? Especially when we’re talking about these situations that have been so ethnically charged, we have to go beyond that. We have to move beyond just the weeping with them and the lamentation. We’ve got to do some other things. What are some of those other things?\\nAurelia Smith: Right, and this is really an important point, because as you’re saying, you know, lament is an excellent initial step, however, in the scenarios I talked about, there are also many other responses that are necessary as well. So, for instance, believers are called to confront one another in love when we sin against one another. Your counselees would need to be encouraged to practice biblical confrontation. Shepherds would also want to get involved to care for the sheep well, not only for those who were hurt but those who need to be taught Scripturally why they did what they did or believed counter to the truth. There are also a host of heart attitudes that we’d want to address as biblical counselors to help our counselors who experienced ethnic incidents to take their thoughts captive, uproot any bitterness, deal with the fear of man, and more. So it’s just an initial response with lament, but not a totality of the response.\\nDale Johnson: See, I love what you’re doing. So what we’re trying to do here is we’re saying, listen, the whole issue about race and ethnicity–nobody’s acting as though these things aren’t real. I mean, there are legitimate tensions, right? Those are born, if we understand these biblically, out of dispositions of sin. We have to address those, but we don’t need to swing the pendulum the way the culture is doing and try to give some sort of secular framework. What we’re trying to do is say, okay, the Scriptures give us an answer. \\nAurelia, you’re helping us to see sort of the multi-faceted way that the Bible, just in wisdom, gives us help and aid in how to lament appropriately—t’s not all lament—but how to lament appropriately. Then also, how do we start moving to address some of the issues of the heart where we might find even partiality or prejudice in our own heart and need to deal with those? That’s okay because that’s what the Bible does. It helps to clean us up. It helps to address the issues that we find deep within, and we should be okay with the Bible’s correction on that, especially as believers. That’s really the goal. I love how you’re shading this in a multi-faceted way because that’s what we need. We need that biblical wisdom. \\nI want to finish with this just sort of final thought—and there’s a lot more to say on this for sure, but I’m glad we’re addressing it. How might both—now let me pause for a second because as I talk about this–the answer mostly in the culture is, we just need to deal with the majority culture. It’s all their fault. So, I love the way that we’re going to talk about this in saying, no, we’ve got issues on both sides, right? I mean, for biblical counselors, we talk about marriage counseling and we say, well, you know, it’s typically not 100% one person’s fault, right? I say, there are enough problems to go around and we can address the issues in both husband and wife. Yes, as a man, I would say that the majority of the problems are probably his. That’s true. But there are enough problems to go around. We sin against one another and then we respond to that sin with more sin, and it complicates things. How might we, in this topic of ethnicity and issues of race, deal with both majority and minority culture Christians as we all try to grow in this area?\\nAurelia Smith: Well, I’d encourage our listeners to think and pray deeply about what they’ve heard first, so on a personal level. Then I’d also encourage us to make a commitment to grow and learn about this issue. My two recommendations for reading would be the newest revised version of One Race, One Blood that I referred to earlier, and also Weep with Me by Mark Vroegop where he delves into the Psalms of Lament in a fantastic way in regards to this particular issue. It’s fantastic. Then I also encourage our listeners to consider what work needs to be done on not only the personal level but in their church families and in their communities. How can they be a bridge? How can they be a redemptive tool in God’s hands to address these issues?\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, I love that. In 2 Corinthians, that’s what Paul calls us, ministers of reconciliation. That’s our goal. What that understands is that there are going to be issues that need to be reconciled, and who has God chosen to do that? He has chosen us as believers and that’s one of our titles, to be ministers of reconciliation. So Aurelia, thank you so much for giving us this. I will mention that some of the things that Aurelia gave you as far as book recommendations, and even her breakout talk, we’ll put that in the show notes so that you can pay attention to that. So dear sister, thank you so much for spending time with us and giving us some good wisdom from the Scriptures.\\n\\nHelpful Resources\\nAurelia Smith’s Breakout Session — Grace Relations Counseling Using Psalms of Lament\\nMinistering to Military Women by Aurelia Smith\\nOne Race, One Blood: The Biblical Answer to Racism by Ken Ham and Dr. Ware\\nWeep with Me: How Lament Opens a Door for Racial Reconciliation by Mark Vroegop\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAurelia Smith is a graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy.

The biblical law of love is what I do for you.', 'body': 'Dale Johnson: This week I am thrilled to invite to the podcast a very familiar voice, and maybe one that you haven’t heard in a while, but I’m really, really excited that Dr. Heath Lambert can be with us. He’s now the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Jacksonville. As many of you know, he started this Truth in Love podcast several years back. I’m so grateful for his ministry and even the work that he’s doing now as senior pastor at First Baptist Jacksonville and the work that he did here at ACBC. He left a wonderful foundation and footing for me that I’m so grateful for and that I benefit from consistently on a regular basis—the work that he labored to do and to accomplish, and the ways that he still supports the ministry. I’m so grateful for the work that certainly First Baptist Jacksonville does in counseling as well. Their Grace Center’s doing phenomenally well. You’ll remember his wife, Lauren, and their children. \\nHeath, I want to say, first of all, welcome to the podcast. I want you to give a quick update. I’ve had several folks ask about you and your family and how you guys are doing, and I try to be a good mailman and give them as much information as I can, but I’d love for you to just sort of give an update on how life is going now that you’re in the saddle there at First Baptist Jacksonville and things are going well, and your health, and things like that.\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, I appreciate that. It is great to be back on the podcast as your guest. I’m grateful for you and your leadership, and all the excellent work you’re doing. Since I left ACBC and left Truth in Love, I’ve been on a wild ride. I love my church in Jacksonville. I love First Baptist. These are the best people in the world, but we just needed to do a lot of things with regard to infrastructure. We had millions of square feet and property and blocks in downtown Jacksonville and we just had to live on a property that we could afford and update the property. That was a long multi-year process that was harder than I knew it was going to be, but in the kindness of God, we’re on the other side of that and that has leveled out. The personal piece with my health—While all that was going on, and struggling with all the turmoil and difficulty of ministry with that, I started having some neurological problems. I’m actually thankful you asked because I get these letters from people and they’re saying, “Oh, we’re sorry. How are your brain tumors or how is the brain cancer?” So, I don’t know how it got out, but it was a neurological problem. I had a compressed nerve in my brain. Some blood vessels dislocated and had worn away the coating on the nerve and so I was having uncontrolled movements on my right side. It was a pretty serious deal. It was impacting my ability to talk, which is a problem if you want to preach. It was impacting my ability to keep my eyes open, which Highway Patrol thinks is a problem when you’re driving. So there were some significant issues that we were facing and it took two brain surgeries. I’m still having some twitches, I’ll call them. I won’t call them full-blown spasms, but the neurosurgeons at Mayo Clinic, say that I am where they want me to be and the severe problems of impeded speech and eyes closing up, and that kind of thing, those things have been eliminated. So what I’m dealing with now are nuisances. I could live that way the rest of my life, but I’m advised that I won’t have to. It’s just nerves are slow to heal. So we’re finally—honestly, I’m not kidding you, the last three to four years, depending on when you start the clock, have been the absolute hardest years of my life, but the Lord has been kind. I’ve learned a lot about the Lord. I’ve learned a lot about God’s people. I’ve learned a lot about ministry. I’ve learned a lot about nerves in your brain. The Lord has been kind and I’m thankful, and I appreciate you asking.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Well, I’m grateful for that brother. I know it was about this time last year, middle of September, we heard about you having your first surgery, and really since then on staff we’ve prayed for you nearly every week. I’m so grateful to hear the work that the Lord is doing there at First Baptist Jacksonville. I’m from that area. What a critical church, and a regional church, and the work that you guys have to do is absolutely important for the sake of the name of Christ and His kingdom. So, I want to say, press on. Now, I’m grateful for that update. \\nI want us to get into this topic. This is a difficult topic. This issue of COVID and how we think about counseling in COVID right now. You know, I want to say this, I think it’s really important, especially for good churches right now. In the beginning, people were just wondering what was going on and not really knowing what to do, and a lot of your bad churches had some difficulty, but right now what I see happening is, a lot of your good churches are having difficulty. People are opinionated. They’ve chosen their sides and this sort of thing. So I love to talk to pastors about this. Heath, you’ve been in this situation as a pastor and you’re dealing with some of the same problems that the rest of everybody is relative to COVID and how we sort out these details and preferences, and this sort of thing. \\nSo, as we think about a lot of congregations, there’s a presence, certainly, of a great deal of massive conflict that’s happening: How to think about issues relative to quarantine and what about vaccines? Should we mandate? Should we be in favor of that? Should we be pushing things like that? How do we think about masking in different parts of the country? It’s varying levels of pressure, I would say. But some Christians want to sort of describe this in some sort of biblical law of love and that biblical law of love requires vaccinations. In your mind, is this some sort of legitimate way to think about the New Testament law of love?\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, that’s a perfect question. You know, these issues of vaccines, quarantines, mask mandates—It is complicated. It is tricky and we’ve all been dealing with it together for, it’s getting close to two years here. Like you said, you know, in March of 2020, we did what everybody did. I mean, we shut her down and closed up. We went online and we did that for several weeks, a couple of months, whatever it was, before we finally realized, hey, I think we can do some different things here. But after the urgency of, we’re going to have millions of people dead in a matter of months—after the urgency of that was over, then we’ve just been trying to grapple with, okay, what is best here on these things? As we’ve talked about this at our church here in Jacksonville, I’ve actually isolated about 10 different realities that are on the table when you talk with people about vaccines, masks, and quarantines, but one of the most crucial ones is this one that you’re asking about and the law of love. What you’ll hear is, you’ve got this New Testament law of love. You’ve got Jesus—the new command that I give you that you love one another—and if we’re supposed to love one another, then that means you’ve got to wear a mask. That means you’ve got to go get vaccinated. That means, if your nose is drippy, you’ve got to quarantine. That means if you were around somebody who sneezed, you’ve got to quarantine. Law love requires it. \\nWhat I want to say is, the biblical law of love is not about what I demand that you do. The biblical law of Love is what I do for you. It’s a little more personal than, you know, I get behind my perch and I say to all of you, here is what love requires you to do for me. Actually, in the Bible in 1 Corinthians 13, that’s a violation of love. In 1 Corinthians 13, love does not insist on its own way. So as soon as I’m telling you what you must do for me, I’m actually not talking about the law of love anymore. I’m talking about being hateful. So I don’t mean to question the motivations of people. I don’t mean to question their sincerity. I actually don’t know what the motivations of people always are, but if the law of love and the Bible allows me to demand you to do anything I want, well, we won’t be able to live that way. There are just so many different ways to cut this pie. \\nThere are wisdom issues that are case-specific. We’ve got people in our church who don’t want to get the vaccine, but they’re married to a wife who has asthma or is immune-compromised, and so for them, the law of love is, I get the vaccine. We’ve got people in our church who are not dealing with an immune compromised situation, but there’s a conscience issue. I strongly believe that this is government encroachment and elimination of rights, and somebody who’s sitting there with antibodies from a previous COVID diagnosis is going, my goodness, I’m going to have a problem in my house if I go get a vaccine. So this is just to say, law of love flattens out conscience. It flattens out wisdom issues. It flattens out preferences, and it actually dangerously misses the opportunity for me to be really, really humble and say, you know what? I don’t know what’s best for every person and every situation. I don’t know what the best data is on all of this. So actually the law of love is to be a little more patient, in this context, than just to demand there’s one right way for everybody based on a limited scope of information.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: That’s so helpful, Heath. As you’re talking, I’m thinking of places like Romans 14 where Paul is certainly talking about preferences and how we should handle these types of issues. I love the way that you just described that this oversimplification of the law of love is flattening it out and it’s actually doing damage in some way to people’s conscience, either overburdening or flattening it out as you’re describing here. Back to Romans 14, we think about preferences. Paul follows that up and Romans 15:1 by making this statement that you who are strong bear with the failings of the weak. We’re sort of hearing this language along with the law of love. Like, if you love other people, which Christ tells us to do, then you’re going to do, X, Y, and Z, but we’re also sort of hearing this in the language of, you who are stronger, you should love your weaker brother enough and respond this way. So what’s the relationship in your mind between the weaker and the stronger brother as it relates specifically to these issues with COVID, like vaccines and masking and quarantines?\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, so I think this one is at least as tricky as the law of love application, and maybe a little bit more, because in Romans 14, you’re dealing with a very, very specific situation there, where the debate is apparently between Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians, where the Jews are going, hey, to be a faithful Christian—It’s different than Galatia where it’s to be a Christian—they’re not doing that. They’re not compromising the gospel, apparently. Look, if you’re going to be a Christian at the head of the class here, you need to observe these days and you need to observe these dietary restrictions. Paul says to those people, actually, they’re the weaker brother and the stronger brother is the one who realizes their freedoms. So I think we just have to be very, very careful before we immediately, establish a one-for-one between masks in the twenty-first century and days and diets in the first century. \\nOne of the ways you’ll hear it—one of the conversations I was just in in my church was—people who think you have to wear a mask, they’re the weaker brother and the stronger brother is the one who is free to not wear a mask. I would say that actually complicates it because even in this conversation, by the end of it, we had one guy who’s very anti-mask say actually, you know what, I realized from this conversation, I’m the weaker brother. I don’t want to wear a mask, but my conscience is disturbed by it in a way that is more true of a weaker brother than a stronger brother. So my rules of thumb on this—You can be a pro mask or an anti-mask. You can be pro-vax or anti-vax. You can be, quarantined for the sniffles, or hey, we were getting sick before COVID and I’m going to make sure you get sick during COVID. It doesn’t matter who you are, you can know if you’re a weaker or stronger brother from Romans 14 based on three tests, in my view. \\nOne is, to you, this is not about freedom but is about requirements. So this is what we have to do. That’s the weaker brother’s problem. The Bible says we have to do this. There’s this requirement. You don’t realize that no, you’re actually, in Christ, more free than you’ve imagined. So actually, this would be a person who would say law of love requires it. If you’re a “law of love requires these things,” then you’re being very law-y. You’re being very rule-y, and to you, we’re not talking about an issue where good Christians can disagree. That puts you at risk of being a weaker brother. \\nA second test would be that your temptation is to judge as guilty of sin those who don’t do it your way. So this is the person who can’t say, if they want to wear a mask, let them wear the stupid mask. This is the person who can’t say, look, if they don’t want to wear a mask, I don’t care if they don’t wear a mask. I’m going to wear a mask if I want to and they don’t have to wear one if they don’t want to. No, this is there’s judgment. Look at that person violating the law of love, walking around with their beard hanging out. Nothing covering it up. This is a violation of the law love and I’m judging you as guilty of sin. This is placing you at risk of being the weaker brother. Then finally, the third thing, and this is the crucial test that is so often misunderstood, even on other issues like alcohol and other things, you’re tempted to follow others in spite of your conscience, which says it’s sin. So this would be, I think we should wear a mask, but I see you not wearing one, and it’s not just that I think you’re wrong, but I’m tempted to have your example lead me to violate my conscience. Those three things together are what place you in danger of being the weaker brother, but you could be on either side of the mask or the vax or the quarantine debate and be that person. So I would say the most important issue about Romans 14 is not, let’s identify in every which way who is the weaker and the stronger brother. That can be, from a contextual standpoint, pretty complicated, but I would say the driving force in Romans 14 is, hey, we can bear with one another. We can not judge the strong and we can not despise the weak. Those rules of thumb for how we respond to one another are always going to be relevant in almost any situation.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, that’s right. That’s clear. That’s exactly, I think, the conclusion in Romans 15:1. We bear the failings of the weak. I think you’re right in clarifying that we sort of have our sides, who we think is weaker and who we think is stronger, but the Bible gives so much more dissecting clarity on these types of issues. Thanks for nuancing those. \\nYou know, one of the things, Heath, that I’ve seen sort of throughout this whole thing is just—And this is on both sides. It doesn’t matter what you think about vaccines, what you think about masks, what you think about quarantining— we are seeing an amazing spirit of fear. People are overwhelmed with fear and worry and anxiety. How do you think about this problem of fear, and how does it play a role for Christians in how they respond to this whole issue of COVID?\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, so, oh my goodness, this is the eye of the tornado. We forget that fear really is a sin. You’re not allowed to be afraid. In the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 6, Jesus says three times, don’t worry, don’t worry, don’t worry. The Apostle Paul in Philippians 4, says, be anxious for nothing. You’re not allowed to be afraid COVID’s going to kill you. You’re not allowed to be afraid the Biden administration is using this to take every vestige of liberty from America. You’re not allowed to be afraid of those things. So by my count, there are a number of fears going here. There are people who are afraid of sickness and death. There are people who are afraid of the cultural shifts and government intrusion and economic collapse, and all of those kinds of things. Then there are people who are afraid of the judgments of others. I don’t want to wear that stupid mask. They’re going to hassle me if I don’t start putting the thing on. It’s a fear-driven decision and not a love-driven decision, or a faith-driven decision. \\nSo, fears are going in every direction. It’s not just that the maskless people are the ones who are bold and brave. You talk to those folks and a lot of times they’re like, I’m afraid of what’s happening to our country. They’re commanding what I can wear on my face and it’s scaring me half to death. So, we’ve got to find a way to deal with these things apart from fear. Not being afraid doesn’t mean a reckless approach to our health. Not being afraid doesn’t mean a reckless disregard for government intrusion and overreach and that kind of thing. But one of the things that’s so helpful to me about Jesus’ response to this is, again in the Sermon on the Mount, He says, who of you by worrying can add any bit to his span of life? What he’s saying is worry’s worthless. It doesn’t get you anything. \\nThere’s a really practical lesson for the kind of people who want to listen to the Truth in Love podcast just that faith is practical and worry is fruitless. So I think the lesson is, hey, let’s do what we can. Do what you can. Think about this as best you can, and then you’ve got to trust the Lord. So you don’t need to wash your hands 150 times a day. You don’t need to stand by the door and wait for somebody else to walk by to open it so you don’t have to touch the handle. How’s that for the law of love? Give him the germs. You don’t take them. You can say, hey, you know what? I’m going to trust and obey. I’m going to be faithful and I’m going to trust the Lord, and when it gets to the point where I’m sitting there stewing, now I’m not being productive. Now. I’m actually being harmful. I’m not trusting the Lord. Another element of the Sermon on the Mount is, Jesus doesn’t just say, don’t worry. He preaches a sermon about two things: God is completely in control of the world and God is bound and determined to use all of that control to love you. Don’t you know you’re worth more than a bird? Don’t you know you’re worth more than grass? So we can have steady confidence that God’s caring for us in COVID. We can be faithful to do what we’re called to do, and then we just don’t have to sit up at night and watch reruns of cable, scared to death of what’s really going on out there.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Amen, brother. Listen, it’s been really good, and thanks for the clarity as we talk about this issue. This is still a real thing. We wish we were on the other side of it, but we’re not. I have to say, it is great to hear your voice again. It’s so great to hear that you guys are doing well at First Baptist Jacksonville. So grateful to be partners with you. You guys are a training center of ACBC. So grateful to hear about Lauren and the children and that they’re doing well, and that your health is great. \\nThank you, brother, so much for encouraging us once again and giving us clarity as we think about hopefully encouragement to pastors and their congregations on how to think through some of these really dicey, difficult, what have become quite volatile, issues. So, thank you, brother\\n\\nHelpful Resources\\nHigh School Curriculum: Foundations for Biblical Discipleship\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

While I do believe there will be perfect unity in relationships in eternity, what about for the span of our lives here on earth?', 'body': 'Growing up as a 90’s kid in the church, I knew Michael W. Smith’s song by heart:\\xa0\\xa0\\n“And friends are friends forever\\nIf the Lord’s the Lord of them….\\nIn the Father’s hands we know\\nThat a lifetime’s not too long\\nTo live as friends”\\nI’ve seen friendships in the church come and go. While I do believe there will be perfect unity in relationships in eternity, what about for the span of our lives here on earth? Close relationships are hard to cultivate and oftentimes harder to keep, even if the “Lord’s the Lord of them.” Biblical community goes beyond Sunday morning fellowship and leads towards sanctifying friendships. Godly friendships spur me towards loving of God, pursuing holiness, and avoiding spiritual shipwreck.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat is Biblical Friendship?\\xa0\\nToday, I taste the fruit of genuine friendship, but this was not always the case. During college I met with a woman week by week and poured my heart out to her regarding the different struggles I had in my friendships. As she did life with me, she not only heard it from me, but saw day by day the ways in which I interacted with my friends. One day, as we sat together, she lovingly said, “Paula, when you go and hang out with people, it is not truly out of love for them but so that you would be liked and approved of by others.” I was a serial people pleaser. What she said pierced through my heart,\\xa0and I knew she was absolutely right. At its root, I was a bad friend because I was out to serve myself. I have since spent time peeling back the layers of my sin of people pleasing and allowing the Lord to transform the ways in which I am a friend.\\xa0Friendship is choosing to love like Christ in close companionship, not for selfish ends, but that God might be glorified in each of your lives.\\xa0These relationships will look differently in scope depending on your season of life, but at its core, we can always strive to cultivate meaningful friendships wherever we are.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeing a Biblical Friend\\xa0\\nA friend at best is always a friend like Christ, seeking\\xa0how we can serve rather than be served. Imitating His heart and His ways should be our aim in friendship.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nJesus\\xa0draws near\\xa0to us not because we deserve His love, but because He is loving (John 1:14; 1 John 4:7-12). I understand the desire to choose friends because “I would love to have a friend like them. They are likeable and fun.”\\xa0There is nothing inherently wrong with that, but the caution would be to consider how Christ’s love is not based on our likeability. One thing we must consider when befriending others is to initiate with those who need a friend not just with the people we want to be friends with.\\xa0\\xa0\\nJesus models\\xa0consistent\\xa0companionship in His earthly ministry. He\\xa0initiated\\xa0each discipleship relationship and stuck with it (Matthew 4:18-22). We do well to follow Christ’s example in pursuing others in friendship. This often means taking the initiative ourselves to have someone over for dinner, invite them to coffee, run errands, and to show up and engage with others at smaller church gatherings. Jesus did ministry alongside His disciples.\\xa0Consider how you can serve in ministry at your local church. Many of my longest and deepest friendships have formed over years of serving in ministry together. Jesus was also intentional in choosing twelve disciples and then within that, an inner circle of three. In our human limited capacities, we can exercise wisdom to know how many people we can realistically be a close friend to. This does not take away from the fact that every interaction we have with our brothers and sisters should be one that reflects Christlike love.\\xa0\\nJesus\\xa0gave\\xa0of Himself\\xa0in love and service\\xa0for the good of others (John 13:34; Philippians 2:3-4). We love others by being quick to listen and understand, meeting practical needs, providing comfort, and considering others more important than ourselves. Do you strive to know the joys and sorrows of your friend (Romans 12:15)? Are you willing to make sacrifices for their benefit\\xa0(1 John 3:16)? If your friend is married with children, are you willing to help lighten the load of caring for their needs? If your friend is an older saint, are you willing to help drive them around and perform hard to do physical tasks for them?\\xa0 If your friend is single, are you willing to include them in the joys of sitting around a full table and participating in family life?\\xa0\\xa0\\nJesus focused on the\\xa0sanctification\\xa0of His disciples (John 17:17). As iron sharpens iron, so one friend sharpens another (Proverbs 27:17). In friendship, there is a level of mutual trust where you are able to bear your soul to one another. Where there is humility, there is openness, transparency, and the eager welcome to wise counsel and accountability. Do you welcome your friends to be honest with their struggles? When your friend confesses sin do you point them to the righteousness, grace, and love of God (Proverbs 28:13)? Are you willing to patiently remind your friends of the truth they need to hear? Are you willing to bear with the implications of how their weaknesses play out in how they relate to you? Do you confess sin and welcome life giving reproof (Proverbs 15:31)? Is your deepest desire for you and your friend to look more like Jesus?\\xa0\\xa0\\nHindrances to Biblical Friendship\\xa0\\nThe deteriorating of friendships starts within individual hearts. We fight against our friends rather than for the preservation of that relationship.\\xa0Be on guard against:\\xa0\\nRivalry\\xa0and\\xa0jealousy\\xa0\\xa0\\nUnhealthy competition and comparison is a recipe for discord (James 3:16; Galatians\\xa0 5:25-26).\\xa0When it comes to the giftings, life seasons, and even the fact that your friends\\xa0cultivate close relationships with others, rejoice with them rather than feel\\xa0threatened. Don’t keep score over the ways you have loved and served others versus the ways they love and serve you (1 Corinthians 13:4-7). When we love and serve like Jesus,\\xa0 we give generously of our time, energy, and resources without expecting something in return (Acts 20:35).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBeing easily offended and prideful\\xa0(Proverbs 19:11).\\xa0\\nThis happens when you are quick to assume and slow to believe the best.\\xa0\\nWhen your friend hurts or offends you, check your own heart rather than beginning to build a case against your friend to justify your hurt. Love is compassionate, patient, and believes all things. In the small and the big things, we must choose to believe the best about one another (1 Corinthians 13:7).\\xa0\\xa0\\nWithdrawing when you are hurt.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAre your reasons revealing a need for love and grace in your own heart\\xa0(Ephesians 4:31-21)? Have you given them the benefit of the doubt in this situation? Are you judging their motives rather than extending grace to their actions (1 Corinthians 4:5)?\\xa0As you ponder, remember God’s kindness towards you leading to\\xa0overlooking the offense and experiencing no change in the warmth of your relationship, avoiding bitterness and anger (James 1:19-20).\\xa0If you realize your friend is walking in unrepentant sin they are blind to, prayerfully consider how to speak the truth in love for their good (Ephesians 4:15; Matthew 7:5; Proverbs 27:6). Do so patiently, gently, in a way that shows genuine concern for their soul (Galatians 6:1-2).\\xa0\\xa0\\nMay we strive to be Christlike, to be a friend with every opportunity we have within the body of Christ in our local churches and leave no person without a friend.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPaula Higuchi is an ACBC certified counselor and Director of the Biblical Counseling Center of Maui.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Pursuing Purity Before Marriage', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Amber Komatsu', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Relationships 16', 'question': 'We are called and even commanded to be lights to a wicked and perverse generation, and we need the Word of God to inform what this looks like.', 'body': 'My name is Amber Komatsu, and\\xa0I am the membership services coordinator at NANC.\\xa0 I started working at NANC about 10 months ago, and it has been absolutely amazing [This conference message was recorded in 2013]. In the first six weeks of working, we had phone calls from every single continent except for Antarctica. I don’t really know why we don’t have a presence in Antarctica yet, but I’m just super grateful. I’m so thankful for the members that are in here. I just love serving you. It’s an honor and a joy. Anyway, I’m 29 years old and to give you some background, I just got married, and I have really wrestled with thinking through matters of purity. Our world is completely against the idea of living a life that honors the Lord.\\xa0\\nI want to think about the culture in which we live. We are in the world, yet not of it. What does this mean? I think that there are two primary errors that our Christian culture and the church has often fallen into. One is legalism. We know that there are those who forbid marriage, and this is wrong. We know that by Scripture. The second is holding up singleness as a higher calling than marriage. We know that singleness is beneficial for being more freed up to serve the church, but it is not holier or a higher calling.\\nThere are two ways that oftentimes believers fall into these wrong ways of thinking. I remember when I was younger saying, “I’m never going to get married,” thinking that singleness frees you up to serve, and this is the first error. The second way we often fall into error is liberalism. Sometimes the church has embraced the sexual morality that it is immersed in. I have friends who for one year, studied over in Germany at a seminary, and they made many friends at the seminary. They talked to different people, and had amazing conversations about doctrine, theology, and life. These people were hardcore on essentials of the Christian faith. They were so hardcore on the resurrection. Core doctrine that we would consider extremely valuable they held to. But they started talking about their personal lives, and it was not uncommon for these seminary students who upheld these beliefs to live with one another and to have kids. My friends, Guy and Virginia, had friends who were getting married and having their child christened at their wedding. It was not thought of as strange. Virginia told her story that they waited to have sex until they were married, and they were laughed at. Their friends thought it was comical that someone actually believed that what Paul says about pursuing purity and morality is what you ought to do. Guy and Virginia had a hard time understanding them and thought, Are you Believers? The doctrine is here, but the practice is not. That’s a very dangerous pitfall the church can fall into. I have no idea about the salvation of these individuals, but it is intriguing that they held to these doctrines, but in their personal lives, they had an entirely different hermeneutic for understanding Paul. They looked at the moralism that they saw in his teachings as leftovers from his Judaism, and that’s how they could throw these things out. Absolutely bizarre, terrible, and just sad.\\xa0\\nWe also see this in I Corinthians 5:1-2, which says, “It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father’s wife. And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.” So, we see this even in the early church. It’s not only today that we see these types of things; It’s throughout history. I think it’s very tempting for us to look at our culture and think that it is in one sense more corrupt.\\nWhen I got engaged, I started going on Pinterest and looking at all these things and was so excited. I started seeing these ads for boudoir shoots. The idea was to get these pictures taken in your lingerie and have it as an engagement gift for your fiancé. I’m shocked by this. This is so common that nobody blinks at it in our culture, and it’s very easy for Christians to be influenced by that in our thinking, and it’s just terrible. This is not something that’s necessarily new; it’s very old. The problem is that today we have so much more available.\\xa0 The internet communicates everything, and back in old times you had to be present to see something immoral going on. Now you just pull it up on your computer. Our culture is inundated with this stuff.\\nWe see this kind of content all around us. How do we as believers saturate ourselves in the Word and have the Word dictate to us what purity looks like and not have the world influence us wrongly? That’s really the problem. The Word is our guide to understanding what the Lord requires of us. We must continually be saturated with the Word and the principles therein that show us how to conduct ourselves in the world without being a part of it. We are called and even commanded to be lights to a wicked and perverse generation, and we need the Word of God to inform what this looks like. There’s great hope because if we are saved and if we have the Holy Spirit, we have the same power that raised Jesus from the dead to enable us to fight this sin. It’s hard in our culture, but it can be done with the power of the Spirit and paying attention to the Word.\\nEffects of the Cross\\nSalvation fuels good works and the pursuit of holiness. First, let’s look at what\\xa0Titus 3:4-8 says, “But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God, may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.” One thing that I love about this passage is that it so clearly shows us that good works do nothing to gain us a standing before the Lord. Salvation is what brings good works. Salvation comes before; it does not come after the good works. Salvation fuels the good works. If there is salvation, there will and must be good works. “Not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy,” but he doesn’t stop there. He says, we have to be “careful to devote (ourselves) to good works.” Good works flow out of salvation. We have to keep that in mind. If we get this mixed up, we become legalistic. It’s a really harmful way of thinking.\\nSecond, our lives preach a sermon. People are watching. Titus 2:1-10 says, “But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine. Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness. Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good and so train the young women to love their husbands and children, to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled. Likewise, urge the younger\\xa0men to be self-controlled. Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so\\xa0that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us. Bondservants are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.” This is an amazing passage. The first part says, “teach what accords with sound doctrine.” What does “accords with sound doctrine” mean? Oftentimes we think of high theological things like the Trinity, and that is very helpful, but this passage shows us that what doctrine looks like when it’s being lived out is young women loving their husbands and having self-control. It’s being pure, working at home, and being kind and submissive. It’s amazing to see how right thinking and right understanding of the Word is going to affect our lives in very practical ways. Scripture says that we adorn the doctrine of God our Savior. It also says that women are to be “submissive to their own husbands, that the Word of God may not be reviled.” That means that we can make the Word of God beautiful by our lives and how we are imitating and obeying what the Lord says to us in Scripture.\\nThe passage continues with verses 11-14: “For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.” I just love that Scripture. We exist to walk in the good works that the Lord has given us, and we know what these are because of Scripture.\\nThe Call and the Command\\nWe know we’re to do good works. They come from salvation; they do not bring salvation. They are evidence and fruit of it. The call for purity and the practical pursuit of holiness is where it gets hard. We can have these things in our minds, but actually finding out what it looks like to live this way in this world can be a very difficult thing. As believers, we are free to be constrained to the boundaries of Scripture. We must let Scripture and not our culture determine what it looks like to be lights to a wicked and perverse generation. We need to pursue purity in action. We see in I Timothy 4:12 that we are to “Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers, an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity.” This again is showing others the beauty of the Lord in our lives and setting an example to others, unbelievers and believers alike.\\xa0\\n\\xa0II Timothy 2:22 says, “So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.” First, we are to flee youthful passions. We are to run away from them and pursue hard after righteousness. Another passage that is helpful is I Corinthians 6:18-20, which says, “Flee from sexual morality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you whom you have from God? You are not your own for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.” Philippians 2:14-16 says, “Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.” These passages show us that we have to pursue obedience to this in our actions. We can’t only sit down and pray really hard and think, Okay, I’m just going to be pure now. We actually have to take action steps to pursue obedience and righteousness, and it gets rough.\\nSecond, we can’t only do this in action, but we also have to do this in our mind. This is where the battle gets particularly interesting because no one else besides God knows what goes on in our minds. You’re the only one who can see your heart and knows what you’re thinking and what you’re dealing with. Here is a verse that show us how we are to pursue purity in our thoughts: “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things,” writes Paul in Philippians 4:8.\\nIf we use this verse in every moment of the day in our thoughts, we would be so helped in making decisions and understanding how to answer the questions What do I put before my eyes? What do I not? What are some boundaries that have to create for myself? They are very helpful and clear verses. Romans 12:2 says, “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” Pursuing purity in our thoughts involves thought renewal as well as understanding the thoughts that are in our head and understanding how we’re going to fight those thoughts.\\nWe’re called and commanded to pursue purity, but what does this practically look like? We see it in Scripture; we can affirm it’s there. How do we actually put this into practice in a world where you watch TV and a commercial pops up, and it’s just heinous stuff? Magazine covers and Facebook ads assault us. I’ve been on Facebook, and my husband walks in right when a terrible ad pops-up. How do we renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age? How do we flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness and think about all things true, honorable, and pure?\\nI’m going to get really practical regarding how to put these verses into action. Let’s look at the three categories of “in singleness,” “in relationship,” and then “in engagement.” The primary objective in singleness is to honor and glorify the Lord. That’s it. That is the prime objective. And that objective doesn’t ever change in any season that we’re in. This should saturate a person’s mind during this time. It is a mind that is fixed upon the Lord in his glory that prepares one for the battle for purity and before surprise attacks come. Something that is important to keep in mind is that the fight for purity in singleness is just simply a foundation for pursuing purity and honoring the Lord for the rest of your life.\\xa0Faithfulness in singleness will have great effect on faithfulness in the future. I’ve been married for two and a half months, and I’ve discovered that it’s not easier to fight sin being married. In a sense, I have to fight harder. When I’m talking to girls who are really struggling in singleness, I want to encourage them that the fight now is so important. It’s so important to seek the Lord now and to fight for purity. You’re honoring the Lord. If the Lord decides you will marry someday, you’re honoring your husband, even during this time when you fight for purity in your singleness. I think this thought is a helpful tool for fighting for purity in singleness.\\nTools for the Fight for Purity in Singleness\\nLet’s look at some key tools for fighting for purity. The first one is prayer. Pray a lot and pray often. Get on the floor and just seek the Lord. Pray that the Lord helps you to honor Him.\\nIt is easy for us to only think of ourselves. Selfishness was a sin I dealt with. It might be wallowing in self-pity or always wanting something else, but when you’re praying, it’s harder to sin. Seek the Lord and ask for His grace. This is essential and foundational for fighting for purity as well as fighting for thankfulness and gratefulness during this time.\\nSecond, it is important to cultivate a thankful heart and a belief that the Lord is always good. A person in his or her singleness can always say, “He’s always good to me. I’m thankful for His goodness.” There is no better situation than the situation the Lord has you in. And it’s just helpful to think on His sovereignty during this time. I think that focusing on the Lord’s goodness and the Lord’s sovereignty will cultivate a thankful heart, and that is a huge key in battling for purity.\\xa0\\nThird, another key tool for fighting for purity is suffering. Elizabeth Elliott wrote a book called The Path of Loneliness. I had that book for two years before I picked it up because of the title. One day I picked it up and read through it in about one sitting. I don’t have the quote, but, essentially, she says that we have to use our suffering as fuel for worship. The truth is that one way to fight for our purity is to allow our suffering and sadness to lead us to the Lord.\\xa0\\nFourth, we need to renew our minds with truth. Our mind is a very interesting battlefield. I remember a time about three years ago that I was sitting in front of a mirror putting on makeup. It was around 6:30 in the morning, and I was getting ready for work. As I sat there,\\xa0a thought popped into my head. Oh, what if I married that person? I think every single person has had that happen to them.\\xa0 Then I thought What if we got married in six months? Oh, we could have these kids. I kept going, and the thoughts weren’t necessarily sinful, but they weren’t helpful. They were not true of me in that moment, and I caught myself creating this fantasy world for Amber Walsh: I’m married. I have six kids, and I homeschool them. And, in about five minutes I realized what was going on. I wasn’t thinking that this was necessarily sinful, but this wasn’t true, and, therefore, it wasn’t helpful. I had to put these thoughts off. Then I had an amazing moment when I thought, Well, what is true of me. This isn’t true, but what is true right now? It’s true that I’m going to work, and I get to serve an earthly master, and in doing that, I get to honor the Lord. And, later on tonight, I get to spend time with my roommates, and I get to encourage them.\\xa0It is so important to renew our mind with truth. The mind can be a huge battleground for women, and if we feed it, we can go crazy with all of these thoughts.\\nKnow Your Own Weaknesses\\nIt’s so important to know yourself and your own temptations and weaknesses. We see so much emphasis put on men who struggle with pornography and images. Women can struggle with them, too. Movies, TV shows, social media, magazines, novels, and time management are all areas of our lives that need discernment. There are certain movies that I would watch as a “chick flick.” Some may be innocent enough, but then a scene would pop up, and I would think, “Oh my goodness, this is not helpful.” Sometimes we just don’t think about how women are affected or impacted by the way romance is portrayed in movies or novels. We may not be visually aroused like men, but movies can cause us to think things that we wouldn’t think if we weren’t watching them. It would bother me to see you kissing. I’d be thinking, “Oh, my goodness. I can’t watch this.”\\xa0Understand where your battle is and take it very seriously. Set boundaries for yourself.\\xa0\\nNovels can be dangerous. I’ve seen some Christian novels that no one should read. Just because Jesus is talked about in one chapter does not qualify it as a worthy book. There was a Christian author as I was growing up, who had written many books, and they’re not necessarily bad. There’s nothing in them that’s wrong, but the books would get me thinking untrue thoughts. I might think I wish I was this character.\\xa0That might not be wrong inherently, but you have to understand how you are responding to this book? Am I wanting to be in it? Am I wanting to live out these events?\\nTime management can be another huge issue during singleness. I think that sometimes we can be way too busy, and we need to cut things out so we can refocus on what’s important. On the other hand, too much free time is not going to help a person’s battle to be thankful and to fight for purity during singleness. They may need to fill their time with good things such as serving at church, finding a family to make a meal for, getting involved in a Bible study or in mentoring younger girls at church, every woman is a younger woman to someone and an older woman to someone. That means we should always be mentored by someone, but we should also be pouring into young girls’ lives. Serving the Lord is a good way to fight for purity and holiness.\\nModesty\\xa0\\nAnother issue that is important to think about as we pursue purity is modesty. This helps our brothers and encourages others, whether we are single or married. Growing up, I read so many books on purity and dressing modestly.\\xa0 But I think some of these books had the wrong motivation.\\xa0Some of them were not teaching good works and dressing modestly to honor and please the Lord. They taught that we have to be careful how we dress because our brothers can’t handle it. The conclusion being that you have to dress a certain way. This is not helpful. It is good to honor our brothers in how we dress, but the primary objective needs to be honoring the Lord by dressing modestly. This includes not showing cleavage or wearing skintight pants and really short shorts and skirts.\\nAnother area that I’ve almost never seen covered\\xa0in books for women pursuing purity is modest behavior. I knew some girls when I was growing up who always wore long skirts. They always had shirts that were very high or wore turtlenecks, but their behavior was so immodest. It’s a matter of humility versus pride and arrogance and having a servant’s heart that seeks to serve others and serve the Lord versus attention-getting speech and selfish actions.\\nWe also need to be quick to encourage versus quick to tear down or complain. We need to have a heart of gratitude and thankfulness versus selfishness and self-pity. I think that we can dress modestly, and then we can behave immodestly because we are wanting attention. These are areas that even I have to fight, and I’m married. These are areas we can struggle with whether we are married or single.\\nRelational Purity\\nWe need to fight for purity in relationships as well. The primary objective is always to honor and glorify the Lord. But fighting for purity in a relationship alongside a brother is going to look a bit different from fighting for purity in the midst of singleness.\\xa0 Again, a key tool for fighting here is prayer. This has to be a daily mindset that you’re dwelling in the Lord, seeking Him at all times, and praying for help and strength to honor Him and to honor the brother that you’re in a relationship with. Clear communication with a boyfriend is key. I have so many friends that got involved in relationships that were heavy on the emotion end of things, but very weak on communication. One area that is essential is to set up boundaries before they’re even needed. Issues to talk through are hand-holding, hugs, and kissing. Are these things that you’re going to do or not do?\\nI would not argue kissing is always a sin, though, I do think it’s extremely unhelpful before marriage. It does not help you to make an informed decision during this time. It’s something to really evaluate biblically and thoughtfully. Think about what your standards will be before you get into a relationship, and then have that conversation with your boyfriend early in the relationship. When we were dating, Trevor and I decided to think about whether or not we could thank the Lord in this moment for what we’re doing. And, if we couldn’t, that would be a really good sign that we shouldn’t be doing it. For us, it’s going to sound bizarre, but we held hands a couple of times and realized that it was not helpful for us. Not everyone would struggle with purity while holding hands, but we realized that we can’t sit here and thank the Lord for this moment. These are gray areas that may seem so innocent. I just couldn’t handle it. But they become not so gray when you are asking Can I be thankful in this moment for this and praise the Lord for it? That helps things to become more crystal clear in understanding if this is a helpful activity; Is it pure or is it unhelpful and could lead to sexual impurity or at least impurity in the mind.\\nAnother thing that’s really good is involving an older godly man, preferably a father but maybe a pastor or small group leader. Having a male authority figure who is godly, seasoned, and wise is especially important for the women in these relationships. This relationship can help to protect her and be\\xa0helpful for the boyfriend to know that he has accountability. He can’t do whatever he wants; there is accountability and a male figure overseeing the relationship. This can look very different in so many situations. Some of my girlfriends lived at home until they were married and then moved out. Some of my girlfriends were married at thirty-one or thirty-two, and that looked different. In those situations, the overseer could be a pastor or a small group leader in the town she lived in.\\xa0\\nWhile boundaries are helpful, they do not guarantee success. The battle for purity and the success of boundaries starts in our thinking. When Trevor and I were dating, we were sitting at a little café one Friday afternoon on our college campus, chatting about theology. I love theology. I love to talk about it, and we’re just chatting about some really dry theological issue. I don’t even know what it was when all of a sudden, I realized that the table was common grace. If the table wasn’t there, I would have wanted to start kissing him so hard. Then I thought about these boundaries we set up and why they’re in place. I’m sitting at a table in a public setting, and in my mind, I’m thinking, “Oh, my goodness!” I had never kissed before, so I didn’t know what I was missing, but I knew it was probably really good! I thought I’m in a completely neutral setting. I’m sitting in a public area, and I am battling these thoughts in my mind so hard right now. I guess I was thinking that the doctrine of sanctification was just amazing, and I clearly remember thinking, My goodness! We’re barely holding hands, and I can’t handle it, and he can’t either. We’re sitting at a table, and in my mind, I am fighting a hard battle right now and thinking that, Wow, Amber! You can’t not fight. You can’t have your guard down.\\xa0\\nRetraining the Mind\\nSometimes a retraining of the mind is needed in order to understand what care and love actually look like. I have a good friend who is a new believer. Every relationship that she had been in, before she was saved was sexually immoral. She was used to sex being a way that she received affection from guys. I love this girl; I’ve never met someone so zealous to learn what the Bible says and to apply it to her life. She started dating a guy at her church who had some really good boundaries set up and who really desired to seek and honor the Lord. His convictions led him to choose not to touch her. They could talk, go on dates, and have fun, but “no touching.” She just had a terribly hard time understanding that this was a good thing. I understood that all she had ever known before was men taking advantage of her and going along with it. She really had to work at understanding that this man is loving and caring for her more now than anyone ever had before, and it looks different from other relationships. But she had to fight hard to retrain her mind. Oftentimes, that’s the case. Praise the Lord that we can renew our mind and be retrained as to what love and care look like.\\xa0\\nAccountability\\nIt is extremely important to have accountability in your relationships. I think it is key in relationships to have community. Be in the church, and be involved. Be in your care group or community group, and be around those you know and not just those who you do not know. You can be in public and be around people and do whatever you want because no one is really going to care. I think that primarily a Christian relationship should be lived out in community because you’re going to be receiving wisdom from older women and older men who know how to speak wisdom into the situation. The world doesn’t care. You can go to a park and do whatever you want, and the world is not going to blink an eye. I think, as a general rule, we should stay in the presence of other believers. If you can, it’s not always possible, be in the context of the Christian community as often as you possibly can.\\nMentoring\\nThis is along the lines of having a male authority figure, but involve a godly, seasoned couple in your lives. This is so important to have someone who can speak truth and be there to give wisdom when we don’t know what to do or are struggling.\\xa0\\xa0\\nEngagement\\nThe primary objective here is to honor and glorify the Lord alongside the man that a woman marries. The key that never changes is that we want everything to honor and glorify the Lord. Having that as a mindset undergirding everything makes this battle so much easier because it’s the foundation on which everything rests.\\nPray! Engagement is a very intense time of close, but not yet. She may be thinking I’m engaged. This is it. To the best of my knowledge, I’m marrying this man. But I’m not married to him yet. It’s just a very strange season, and there can be some very interesting battles during that season. It’s okay now to think about this man as her husband, but he’s not yet. So, it’s a matter of finding that place of holding things loosely and knowing that this is probably what’s going to happen. The Lord has been kind to bless them to this point, but they’re not entirely sure until they say yes at the altar.\\nI think that oftentimes during engagement, we have a tendency to loosen up on any boundaries that were created during the dating period. The reasoning is Well, I’m marrying him, so now everything’s okay. But that’s not true. And, I would argue that a person really needs to tighten up on the boundaries and press in harder.\\nThe need for boundaries becomes more intense during engagement. It’s so important to not be fooled into thinking that it is going to get easier to fight for purity with your fiancé, just because you’re getting married. I think it actually gets much harder because in one sense you know that marriage is coming and, with it, the marriage bed.\\nMy friend is getting married in a month and a half. She got engaged two weeks ago, and\\xa0she’s thinking Okay, a month and a half. I need to fight harder than I did for the previous three months.\\xa0It may seem like a short amount of time would be really easy to lighten up and not really care, but it’s been encouraging to see her fight harder and set more boundaries and be very careful to involve themselves in community. You’re not married until you say your vows to one another. It’s so easy for girls to think I’m engaged. Now everything is okay. No, when you’re married everything is okay and pure and right. When you’re engaged it still isn’t. You have to fight harder in that time.\\xa0\\nGuard your communication and your speech. It’s easy during engagement to start talking about things that you do need to talk about in one sense, but can be challenging in your fight for purity. This is another area that we need to be really careful in. Can I thank the Lord for this moment and this conversation we’re having or is it causing me to think impure thoughts and really want things right now I’m not supposed to be wanting?\\xa0\\nFinally, fight hard for your purity to honor Jesus and increase your joy in marriage. When Trevor and I had just gotten engaged (we had a six-month long engagement), we were both in school full-time. Life was crazy. I was working full time. He was working 30 hours a week. The week after we were engaged, we were at our favorite coffee shop, and I really wanted to hold his hand. I felt stupid for even thinking that I couldn’t hold his hand. Let’s just hold hands, you know? And he looked at me as if he was thinking, I want to hold your hand, too, but I just can’t. It would not be helpful in this battle right now. We both looked at each other and realized\\xa0that we couldn’t hold hands because we knew our minds. We couldn’t have what we wanted right now, and we wanted to honor Jesus more than we wanted this sin, so we developed a way of saying, “We’re storing up future joy by denying ourselves in this moment and in this pleasure right now, I am building up so much joy for marriage, and I’m so grateful. The Lord humbled us and helped us to fight.\\nThe biggest thing that helps a woman fight in this area is the understanding that we honor and glorify the Lord in our actions and our thoughts. This is the main goal in all of our lives. My mom has been married thirty-two years. And I love talking to these older, married women because they tell me that marriage is about honoring and glorifying the Lord. A husband doesn’t fill you up and satisfy you in the ways that Jesus does. That just makes me love my husband more because I can just accept things and know that we are fighting sin together.\\nIn singleness, dating, and engagement, the key thing to remember is that we have to honor and glorify the Lord in everything that we do. And this battle doesn’t change. Pray that the Lord enables you to fight hard in those areas; it’s fruitful when you’re single, it’s fruitful when you’re dating, and it’s fruitful when you’re engaged because it only helps you fight more when you’re married. I’ve been married two and a half months, so I don’t know what’s coming, but I know that I’m trusting the Lord to help in the battles that are ahead and praying that these principles continue to help.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmber Komatsu lives in Jacksonville, FL, where she and her husband Trevor serve at First Baptist Church of Jacksonville.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

Has a counselee yelled at you? Did they hit a wall or break something?\\xa0Have you ever had a counselee threaten to hurt you, himself, or someone else?\\xa0\\nAt times, you will encounter\\xa0a man, woman, or child\\xa0who\\xa0is using\\xa0fear\\xa0to manipulate the counselor/parent into giving them what they want.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile working at Victory Academy for Boys, I’d have up to ten\\xa0children\\xa0living in my home (this included my own). There were many times I was afraid that a boy might hurt someone if he were corrected. Other times I found myself avoiding my counseling/parenting responsibilities because I didn’t want to have to deal with the 45-minute-long hassle that would follow if I addressed the child’s behavior.\\xa0\\nI know what it’s like to counsel out of fear, I know well how to parent out of fear, but I also know that neither pleases God. Thankfully, He has a plan.\\xa0\\n1.\\xa0As Christians, we must\\xa0never\\xa0fear\\xa0man.\\u202f\\xa0\\nProverbs\\xa029:25\\xa0warns us that,\\xa0“The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the Lord is safe.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe need never fear what our counselees may do because we serve a God Who is far greater and more powerful than they. Our homes and bodies may bear the marks of a wrathful child, but we need never be afraid of that child because He who is in us is greater than he who is in the world (1\\xa0John 4:4).\\xa0\\nDoing what God commands is always wiser than doing what man demands because the consequence for disobeying God is always worse. God has filled the New Testament with one\\xa0anothers\\xa0that include counseling and teaching and reproving and rebuking in truth and love (Proverbs 19:25; Luke 17:3; Romans 15:14; Ephesians 4:15;\\xa01\\xa0Timothy 4:11; Galatians 6:1; James 5:19-20). We’ve been called by the sovereign King of the universe to intentionally and premeditatedly parent our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. Refusing to submit to God because we’re afraid of how our counselee might respond is allowing the counselee to dethrone Christ in our lives.\\xa0\\nIn Luke 12:4 Jesus admonishes His followers,\\xa0“I say to you,\\xa0My\\xa0friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that have no more that they can do.”\\xa0The\\xa0God-Man\\xa0(Who would eventually allow His own creation to crucify Him) poses the question, “What’s the worst\\xa0they can do?”\\xa0\\xa0\\nBut then He continues in verse 5,\\xa0“I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell.\\xa0Yes, I tell you, fear him!”\\u202fMy friends, there is far more\\xa0reason to fear God when we’re\\xa0not\\xa0faithfully counseling in truth and love than there is to fear our counselees when we are.\\xa0\\nBut Jesus continues,\\xa0“Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies?\\xa0And\\xa0not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered.\\xa0Fear not; you are of more value than many sparrows.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn verses 4 and 5 Jesus just told us to fear God, but then in verse 6 He illustrates that if we are followers of Christ, we have nothing to fear because God loves us.\\u202fRomans 8:28\\xa0sums\\xa0up this lesson well—when we love God, believe His Word, and are actively trying to fulfill His plan in our lives, we have nothing about which to worry. God will orchestrate it all for our greatest good and His greatest glory. But if we do not obey the Lord, it would be wise to fear the consequences of sin.\\xa0\\nSo, the next time you’re tempted to ignore a counselee’s sin or dread the moment your child wakes or flinch when the person in front of you gets\\xa0angry,\\xa0remember that your God is bigger and more important.\\xa0\\nWe are never to fear\\xa0man\\xa0because God is preeminent—He is to have first place in our counseling and parenting (Colossians 1:18). And for that reason:\\xa0\\n2.\\u202fAs Christians, we must never negotiate with\\xa0those who manipulate.\\xa0\\nActs 5:29\\xa0“We must obey God rather than men.”\\xa0\\nIf my child or counselee is\\xa0seeking to manipulate\\xa0me, I mustn’t allow him to dictate the conversation, the activity, the bedtime, the electronics, the rules, the discipline, the friends, the schedule, the consequences, or especially my emotions. When someone is acting like a terror, she has no right to dictate anything because she isn’t demanding God’s will.\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow, I’m not saying that biblical counselors shouldn’t allow counselees to take ownership of their counseling. I am not saying that within the normal context of a functioning, Christ-honoring home that I don’t allow my kids to have a significant say in the activities we do. What I\\xa0am\\xa0saying is that anyone who uses terror tactics to usurp authority does not have the right to dictate what’s to be done or how it’s to be done. Instead, the counselor/parent must stand calmly in God’s\\xa0truth and be consistent within His commands.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn Psalm 140:6, David beseeched the Lord not to\\xa0“grant\\xa0…\\xa0the desires of the wicked.” This is very easy to apply to the\\xa0person\\xa0in front of us, however, in my attempt to avoid negotiating with\\xa0the\\xa0him, I must never resort to terror tactics myself. I cannot glorify God if I have wicked desires. If I lose control, threaten, act unlovingly in any way, or otherwise\\xa0manipulate the counselee into listening to me, I’m sinning just as much as they are. I must be humble, gracious, loving, patient, and kind as I resolutely submit to God’s plan.\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\nYes, sometimes counseling and parenting can be scary, but God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and discipline (2\\xa0Timothy 1:7). We never have to fear our counselees whether they be our own children or someone else’s parent. God is in control!

What can a counselor learn\\xa0in order to\\xa0prevent misunderstandings and how can she repair damaged feelings?\\xa0\\nI found myself in the position of needing to repair a friendship which could have been broken by my careless words.\\xa0This treasured\\xa0friendship\\xa0grew in my counseling office a few years ago. My friend\\xa0and I\\xa0became\\xa0close as we worked through\\xa0a painful\\xa0life circumstance together.\\xa0The tissue box was passed around a few times\\xa0among\\xa0the two of\\xa0us and my observer. When my friend graduated from counseling, I figuratively and literally left my door open\\xa0for\\xa0her to call when she needed to talk again. Recently, I received a text asking for a conversation. Before we\\xa0had a chance to\\xa0speak, I shared part of her text with a mutual friend, a\\xa0section\\xa0which I thought\\xa0was public knowledge. I\\xa0didn’t\\xa0realize that the information was meant to be kept private. Later, I found out that my dear friend had been hurt that I let someone else know the contents of her text. I was crushed.\\xa0People-pleasing\\xa0fears\\xa0rose up\\xa0in my heart. I was afraid that my friend would no longer trust me and\\xa0that\\xa0our friendship was irreparably broken.\\xa0Here is what I learned:\\xa0\\nMove\\xa0quickly towards the offended person.\\xa0When I found out that my friend was hurt, my husband urged me to call her immediately. I wondered, “Should I call? Would I just be stirring up more problems? What will I say?” I knew that Matthew 5:23-24 applied in this situation: “So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.” The need to pursue reconciliation is so great that it comes before offering gifts in worship. I\\xa0realized that I\\xa0should\\xa0call\\xa0her as soon as possible.\\xa0\\nSpeaking in person is best.\\xa0I could have sent an email or a\\xa0text\\xa0but\\xa0I knew that personal\\xa0communication\\xa0facilitates\\xa0understanding.2See Jim\\xa0Newheiser’s\\xa0blog:\\xa0https://ibcd.org/talk-to-me-dont-text-me/ The give and take of conversation\\xa0allowed\\xa0her\\xa0to\\xa0hear my heart and\\xa0helped me\\xa0understand her feelings. I quickly grasped why my comments had impacted her. I\\xa0hadn’t\\xa0seen her perspective until she explained it to me.\\xa0The truth in Proverbs 18:13 struck me: “If one gives an answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame.” We both followed James 1:19— “let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger.”\\nAssume\\xa0the best of the other person.\\xa0I know that my friend is gracious and forgiving. Philippians 4:8 teaches\\xa0me\\xa0to focus on the things which are worthy of praise.\\xa0Also, the verse,\\xa0“love hopes all things” (1 Corinthians\\xa013:7) directs me to expect a righteous response. In fact, when she answered my call, my friend immediately said with a chuckle, “I know why you’re calling.” Before I could say anything else, she said, “I forgive you!” What a joy to experience reconciliation which reflects how God has reconciled us with Himself (2 Corinthians 5:18).\\nBe humble.\\xa0I was glad to admit my fault to my dear friend, but her gracious response made it easy.\\xa0I\\xa0experienced the\\xa0blessing\\xa0of asking\\xa0for forgiveness\\xa0and being granted forgiveness. The Lord truly gives more grace. He “opposes the proud\\xa0but\\xa0gives grace to the humble”\\xa0(James 4:6).\\xa0We\\xa0don’t\\xa0go wrong when we approach each other with humility.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMy friend also went through some steps on her part which made our reconciliation so smooth. She told me that she “talked herself down” when she began to be upset with\\xa0me.\\xa0In other words, she battled her hurt with\\xa0biblical truth, rather than her emotions.\\xa0She even spoke Scripture out loud! This helped her to take her thoughts captive (2 Corinthians\\xa010:5).\\xa0She also was quick to overlook my sin. She covered it with love (Proverbs\\xa019:11)\\xa0and\\xa0forgave as she had\\xa0been forgiven (Ephesians\\xa04:32).\\xa0\\xa0\\nMy friend later told me that this misunderstanding felt as if the enemy was trying to discourage her, telling her that she\\xa0can’t\\xa0trust anyone. It seemed like a tangible spiritual battle.\\xa0The enemy is a liar (John 8:44) and loves to divide believers from one another.\\xa0Our relationship\\xa0is a threat to him and his constant schemes. But God is good.\\xa0My friend\\xa0writes, “Praise the Lord that the Holy Spirit was speaking to us both and that the door\\xa0[to sin]\\xa0was shut so quickly!”3Referring to the Lord’s words to Cain in Genesis 4:7, “And if you do not do well sin is crouching at the door.”\\nIn conclusion, my regret over my careless words quickly faded away into gratefulness and love for my friend. The experience of offering and receiving forgiveness has drawn us even closer together.\\xa0My door has remained open to future dialogue.\\xa0Thankfully,\\xa0I\\xa0learned\\xa0some important lessons which will improve my counseling and benefit others.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCaroline Newheiser is the Assistant Coordinator of Women’s Counseling at Reformed Theological Seminary – Charlotte.

We are in week 4 or 5—or maybe even 6 depending on where you live—of our stay-at-home orders, our quarantining, our social distancing. We’ve passed the threshold of the adrenaline, where something feels different, and now this is becoming sort of a normal routine. That’s quite different, isn’t it?\\nDo you feel yourself longing for social relationship? Longing to be with people? Longing to sit with people and to give people a handshake and a hug and just be with each other?\\nLonging for Community\\nThere’s a reason that we long for that. For we who believe, we long to be in a community together. We long to be with one another. We long to engage in the one anothering of Scripture. A good question I think we can talk about in these days is: How in the world do we engage in one anothering while we’re staying at home and while we’re apart?\\nI think the Scripture actually gives us some really decent principles to help us with this. This is not really all that different than when we would normally be together. Just the social structure becomes a little bit different. We see that much of the New Testament was written by Paul, and it was written because he was in a different social location. He was in a different place than the people he wanted to write to.\\nIt’s interesting to me how Paul, from the outset in almost every letter that he writes, begins with an endearing statement about those he is writing to.\\xa0Galatians and maybe 1 Corinthians are exceptions, where his tone is quite different because he’s engaging some major problems and issues, but even in some of the other letters when he’s engaging problems of the church in that location, he still begins with an endearing statement about these people that he’s writing to. I think that’s fairly instructive for us.\\nPaul’s Example to the Corinthians\\nI would encourage you during these days to mimic Paul. We long to be with one another and we’ve now reverted to things like texting and email and those sorts of things, which are great for the present time. They’re the ways in which we communicate—there’s nothing wrong with that, to use them and make sure that we keep connected with with folks whether it is through text or email. Listen to the way Paul speaks to the Corinthians and introduces his letter in 2 Corinthians 1,\\n“Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too. If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer. Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.”\\nHere Paul is engaging the hearts and the minds of the people in Corinth exactly where they are. That’s important and instructive for us that Paul understands what the people are wrestling through.\\nI would say to you as a pastor, I would say to you as a church member, maybe a small group leader: Make sure that you’re engaging with your people on some level. That’s now through mediums like Zoom, texting, or FaceTime. Whatever it is that you use, make sure that you’re staying connected with your people to know: What is it that they’re suffering with? How do we go about comforting them and then making time to write notes to them, to check in with them, to make a phone call, to build that one anothering yet still.\\nUnfortunately, I think in our normal routine of church, what we see is is contrasting to what Paul says here. Paul is connected enough, even though he’s distanced from these people in Corinth, and he cares enough to hear reports to know what’s going on in these in these folks’ lives.\\nI would venture to say that for many of us in normal church flow and routine, we walk in the door. We say, “Hello, how are things going?” And it’s hard for us to engage in one anothering because maybe we don’t know the people well enough. We can’t tell: Are they having a good day or a bad day? We can’t tell how their week has gone because we haven’t talked to them in 7 days or 10 days or 14 days. Paul is keeping connected with these people, and he’s able to speak to them very pointedly using the hope of the Scriptures, encouraging them to endure the suffering that they’re currently going through, knowing that comfort’s on the other side and that God’s going to empower them with this comfort so that then they can use that for the sake of comforting others. This is how we build one anothering.\\nPaul models one anothering for us here, and gives us an example of how we are to engage people—especially in times just like this, where people are suffering in many ways. People have lost jobs. People are distanced. People are alone. People are separated from folks that they normally interact with and engage with. So there are real issues. There are physical issues that people are struggling with, people going without food, people looking at their bank account watching it dwindle at the current moment, and they are in real, legitimate need. For us to stay connected enough with people where they they feel comfortable humbling themselves and saying, “You know what, in this moment, I need help.”\\nI think this is a wake-up call for us in the church to engage people well enough, be real with people, remove the facades and the masks that we wear, so that we can humble ourselves and say, “You know what, I got laid off last week and I don’t have a lot of reserve and I need help.”\\nThis is a great moment for the church to come together where we can provide for those physical needs. We can take care of one another. We can comfort each other in these types of ways, but that’s not the only way. In so many ways, we’re all struggling to some degree with the new normal. We’re being vexed in so many ways spiritually, which is this tug-of-war, this tension of growth. How do we grow? You have to know your people to help them through moments like this.\\nKnow your people well enough and be a welcoming ear, where they know that you’re willing to listen, and not just hear for the sake of hearing to try and make them feel better with words, but you’re willing to be resolved to help them. That’s one anothering. This is a part of what Paul is saying here, he’s comforting them in their affliction. We can do that, but we have to make sure that we stay connected well enough and know people well enough and are transparent enough.\\nHe doesn't allow them to just settle for self-focus. He encourages him through their suffering to use it for the intention that God has purposed in them. Click To Tweet\\nAs Paul talks about, he’s okay with acknowledging his own suffering—his personal suffering. In doing so, that’s inviting to people. Then he comforts them with the truth of Scripture and says, “Now for you, go and do likewise.” He doesn’t allow them to just settle for self-focus. He encourages him through their suffering to use it for the intention that God has purposed in them.\\nWe know that when we walk through trials, this is for our sake. It’s for our good—to grow us in perseverance, comfort, and hope, which is to be poured out now for the sake of others. One of the ways we foster one anothering is we help people to utilize what God is teaching us in this moment and pour that out for the benefit of others.\\nPaul’s Example to the Philippians\\nA second thing I want us to consider is Paul’s letter to the Philippians. He writes a letter. Can I encourage you to sit down at your desk or the kitchen table, pull out an old-fashioned pen and piece of paper and write somebody a note. Now yours is not going to be inspired, we know that, but the fact that you’re thinking about somebody will be evident. And when they receive that letter a few days later, the fact that you were thinking about them, praying for them—what an encouragement that is when they get that letter to know that somebody was thinking about them, somebody had enough concern to care about them. Listen to the way Paul does this here in Philippians. Remember Paul is writing this from prison.\\nStarting in Philippians 1:3, he writes,\\n“I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”\\nPaul is encouraging the Philippians that what God has begun in them, He will bring to completion. He helps them to focus on eschatological hope for when Jesus returns.\\nIn verses 7-11, he says,\\n“It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel. For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.”\\nPaul is helping them to work through this difficult situation with an eye toward what’s to come. None of this is meaningless. None of the affliction, none of the suffering that they’re dealing with at this present moment is meaningless, because God is doing something in it.\\nHe keeps in mind not to wallow in our self-focus, which is so easy for us to do when we’re isolated and when we’re being afflicted in so many ways by fear. What Paul does is graciously and kindly—as a good shepherd would do—foster this type of one anothering among his people. And he models this for them. Pastors, can I tell you, please do this among your people. Acknowledge truly where your people are and what they’re struggling with—Paul never runs away from the reality of what people are walking through.\\nAnd then he helps point them to the hopes that they have in Christ. Prayerfully, you’ve been teaching the Word of God to such a degree that your people have anchors that they can hold to and you can remind them of those things during these days.\\nThe whole of the book of Philippians is really about this focus on rejoicing. Rejoicing despite their circumstances. Paul is writing from prison and what he’s helping his people focus on, even in his scenario and situation, is not difficulty, but to rejoice despite. Rejoice despite what he’s experiencing now. To get back to the basics, to learn to rejoice no matter what. We have a God who is worthy of rejoicing over.\\nThis is how we begin to foster one anothering. As Paul is modeling this for his people, he’s teaching his people how to do this for those who are in their sphere of influence. Pastors, you engage your people in this way—writing, texting, calling them on the phone, talking with them in this type of language—how your heart yearns to be with them, you care for them. You’re teaching your small group leaders, you’re teaching your Sunday School teachers, you’re teaching the leaders in your church to then go and do likewise.\\nThe magical thing that happens in moments like this is God turns us away from ourselves toward the good of other people, as we die to the hunger and evil passions within our hearts to serve ourselves. Click To Tweet\\nYou’re teaching them, by modeling, how to anchor folks’ hearts to the truths of who God is and keep their eyes not on the temporal moment, but toward the glory of Christ—turning them outward. The magical thing that happens in moments like this is God turns us away from ourselves toward the good of other people, as we die to the hunger and evil passions within our hearts to serve ourselves.\\nIt turns us outward to care now about the others who may be suffering. We grow in compassion, grace, mercy, kindness, and tenderness toward the needs of others. This is how you begin to foster one anothering, as we teach our people through moments just like this to rejoice.\\nCan you take a moment just today? Think of two, three, four, or five people in your church where you can write a transparent note. You could write an encouragement from the Scriptures to demonstrate how you’ve anchored your heart on the Lord and how you would encourage them to do the same—acknowledging the difficulty in which we live and beginning to foster relationships just like this so that you obey still in social distancing the commands to one another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'What the Bible says about Codependency', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 243', 'author': 'Cheryl Bell  Samuel Stephens', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Relationships 16', 'question': 'How does a biblical view of codependency differ from a secular view?', 'body': 'Dale Johnson: Dr. Sam Stephens, our Director of Training Center Certification, was able to sit down with Dr. Cheryl Bell to discuss this very important topic that floats around in our culture, especially in the world of counseling. Cheryl Bell is an adjunct professor at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, where she teaches in the women’s studies and counseling program. She also counsels women who attend the institution. She loves to see God transform his children’s lives by His Spirit and through His Word in the classroom and in the counseling room. I appreciate Cheryl so much. She was a student along with me in the PhD program at Southwestern and I know you’re going to appreciate the conversation that she and Dr. Stephens will have on this subject of codependency.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0Well, Dr. Bell it is always a pleasure to speak with you. Glad you’re here with us today at our podcast. We’re covering a topic that I think people hear a lot about, but they may not fully understand – and that’s the concept of codependency. To get us started, could you give us a definition or understanding of codependency?\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0The term actually originated through popular psychology in the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Originally it was a fairly limited term that talked about the excessive reliance of one individual on another, and the context in which that usually happened was either addiction or illness. Since that time, the term has grown to include any kind of relationship where there’s excessive dependence and neediness on the part of one individual in the relationship on another.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0That’s interesting. We see a lot of psychological categories that originated for very specific use that have grown to be used in a lot of different contexts. In terms of a psychological view of codependency, how would that either correlate or even contradict with a biblical view? Can you help us navigate those waters? What does that look like when it comes to biblical use? Is that a term that’s valid? Does it contradict a biblical worldview?\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0This is definitely a term that has come out of the world of human wisdom rather than a biblical term. When you go to look for a biblical model, when I was searching for Scripture that I felt spoke to this, I ended up in Isaiah 30.\\xa0 You see there not just an individual who is overly dependent on another individual, but you see a nation. We know that nations are made up of individuals, so this was heads of households, government leaders, religious leaders who were willing to give up what they had in the context of being God’s chosen people in order to look to other sources to have their needs met. Isaiah 30 parallels nicely with what we would describe as codependency, but God calls it something very different. He has a different name for it and one of the things that’s very important in biblical counseling is calling things what God calls them. In this particular text, particularly in the first five verses of Isaiah 30, we see that God calls excessive reliance on someone other than himself rebellion. If we’re going to call this what it is, we have to be biblical and call it rebellion.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0Thinking of it that way, how does God respond to those who choose codependency or, in terms as you laid out for us, rebellion over a dependence upon him?\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0Well in the first few verses he says, “Woe to the rebellious children who execute a plan, but not mine, and make an alliance, but not in my Spirit, in order to add sin to sin.” Just in that text, you see not only behavioral expressions of what our world would call codependency, but we see what its root is in the heart, which is the desire to add sin to sin. From a biblical counseling perspective, it gives us a lot of insight. Then it goes on from there to talk about how they always went down to Egypt to get help and how that was vain or empty because Egypt had no power to help them. Behaviorally we see making alliances and plans with anyone other than God, and a heart attitude that desires to add sin to sin.\\nIf you start thinking about who we are as people, we’re made as dependent creatures. We would all be able to affirm that biblically. We really have one of three choices: we’re either going to be independent, we’re going to choose codependence as the world would call it, or we will choose God-dependence. What’s fascinating about this is that both independence and codependence are sinful. They are something that God condemns and they are both rooted in pride. If I choose independence, I think I’m best able to give myself what I want when I want it. If I’m in codependence, I believe that others are best able to give me what I want when I want it. So then I tie myself to them relationally and manipulate them in order to get them to give me what I think it is I need.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0Well that’s interesting. Do you find that many counselees that come to you who self-identify that they’re in a codependent situation would articulate that to you in a very passive way? Like, “Well, we’re just in this codependence relationship.” They would never categorize it as rebellious.\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0No. Now I was just recently counseling a young woman. She actually presented with anxiety, but it was rooted in what our world would call codependence, which is an extreme fear of losing the people that she was dependent upon. When I took her to this text, she was very offended that God would call it rebellion.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0Because it makes her the aggressor in a sense.\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0Yes, so it was interesting to see the presenting problem as anxiety, but to understand the root was pride. She had seen herself as making progress and growing because she was becoming more and more independent. So I had to challenge her there as well, that she was moving from codependence to independence, but both were rooted in sin, and what God required of her was God-dependence.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0I see this in a lot of different psychological worldly categories for problems, anxiety being another one of those examples very similar to what you’re saying, that it seems to be very passive, something that happens to me or comes upon me. Yet, when you look at biblical foundations, it is actually us who are the ones that are offending.\\nWhat are some tips or some helps that you could give our listeners? Maybe they have a counselee that is presenting with codependency or uses that kind of language. What are some helps that you can give us to equip them to engage this in a biblical fashion?\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0Well, I can go back to the specific example, and I approached it like I would any kind of counseling session in that first we established a relationship. I got as much data from her as possible about her situation until I felt like I understood it well and that she trusted me. It was probably about the third or fourth session when I took her to Isaiah 30. Even at that point it was a little bit early possibly, but she did not consider that a good session. Since then, she’s come back and been more willing to work. As you pointed out, she saw herself more as a victim of emotions that she couldn’t control, but that forced her to face the fact that she was choosing to depend first of all on someone else and then consequently on herself instead of on God. She thought she had grown because she’d given up as much dependence on others and turned toward independence. So it was a shock to her.\\nUltimately, what we have to confront these people with is the fact that if you go on in Isaiah 30, you see that this is linked to the sin of idolatry. I love God’s heart in the middle of it. In the midst of the rebellion of codependency in verse 18, if you look at the Hebrew of that verse and you understand it correctly, it says, “God longs to be gracious to you. He longs to have mercy on you, and he is just.” And the last phrase of the verse says, “Blessed are those who long for him.”\\nTaking that counselee from a place of longing to be independent or longing to be dependent on anyone other than God to seeing the heart of God that longs for this intimate relationship and is just waiting to pour out his mercy and grace is part of the key of bringing them back to himself. The chapter goes on. It talks about how God uses adversity and affliction to gain their hearts, and once he’s gained their heart, they destroy their idols. Because at the heart was the sin of idolatry where they would worship anything other than him. It’s a beautiful picture of that whole process of God drawing his people back to himself.\\nNow in the counseling relationship, what I would work with an individual on is that they would confess the root. Obviously they’re seeing the troubled and problematic outward behavior. But so many times people will confess the outward behavior as sin, but they don’t either recognize or are not willing to confess the root as sin. And in this case that would mean that they would have to say, “I am rebellious. God, please forgive me,” and then repent by thinking rightly about their relationship. Here we’re back to the Matthew 22 passage: love God, love your neighbor, and the Luke 9:23 passage, which is die to yourself. And once those relationships are right, then you would have them commit to being God-dependent. And I love Psalm 62:5-8, “My soul, wait in silence for God only, for my hope is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation, my stronghold; I shall not be shaken. On God my salvation and my glory rest; the rock of my strength, my refuge is in God. Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him. God is a refuge for us.”\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0So to boil it down would be that this is really about thinking rightly about relationships, both relationships with other people and making sure that we have our relationship with God as our fundamental relationship. When that is done rightly, then everything else is influenced and trickles down from that.\\nCheryl Bell:\\xa0Everything else will take its proper place once God is first.\\nSam Stephens:\\xa0Well, Dr. Bell, thank you for helping us talk about this subject, but put it in the right framework. I think much of our counseling can come down to that very thing. Our relationships with other people and even how we view ourselves, all of it is impacted and influenced by our relationship with God and thinking about him rightly.

He is a professor of biblical counseling at the Baptist Bible College and Theological Seminary in Springfield, Missouri. He’s also a pastor at Sunrise Church in Ozark, Missouri. Kevin, we’re so grateful that you’re here to spend a little bit of time with us today.\\nKevin Carson:\\xa0Thank you for the invitation. It’s a joy to be with you and to serve ACBC.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Can you explain for us what it means to have biblical friendships and true biblical accountability?\\nKevin Carson:\\xa0My thumbnail definition of a friend is someone who walks through life together in wisdom. It’s someone who is there when days are good and when days are bad. They’re someone who helps you. It’s an individual who loves you enough and cares for you enough to walk with you. There are key friendships I’ve had over the last 40 years that have served me well, and there are times friends haven’t served me well. There’s the good and the bad of friendships. As you and I both know as you watch the headlines, there’s a number of pastors, biblical counselors, and Christians in general who needed friends and when someone needed to speak to him no one was talking. It’s a concern I have that as brothers and sisters in Christ, we learn the value of friendships.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0When we think about how important our friends are, the Scriptures talk so much about the things that we hear from other people in the way that we’re counseled and the attention that we give to certain people’s voices, whether that be for the sake of encouragement or keeping us away from difficulty. These are critical relationships. If you’re looking for a good friend or some sort of accountability partner to walk alongside of you, what would you describe as some of the critical and key characteristics of a biblical friend?\\nThat is a fantastic foundation for a friendship: the person who fears God above everything else and the person who obeys God, trusting and obeying.\\xa0 Click To Tweet\\nKevin Carson:\\xa0I’ve cherry picked a few because there’s so many biblical principles we could talk about. One of them I love is Psalm 119:63 where the Psalmist says, “I am a companion of all those who fear you and of those who keep your precepts.” That is a fantastic foundation for a friendship: the person who fears God above everything else and the person who obeys God, trusting and obeying.\\xa0I think of Daniel with his three friends. When you read this story, you see four men who feared God over the king and feared God over consequences. They were committed to each other and to obeying His precepts. Among all the biblical stories, that’s one where you can see that key concept of one who fears God and respects God or obeys God as a key concept for friendship.\\nPsalm 1 is also helpful when it talks about the happiness of the person who walks not, stands not, and sits not with sinners or a world system and doesn’t listen to the value judgment of the world around us. That’s another one of those key ideas in my mind is that you are looking for people who love Christ, are walking with Christ, and have the wisdom of Christ in the process of doing life.\\nA third one that I love is in Psalm 15 when the Psalmist basically says, “Who can hang out with God on His holy hill?” and then gives an entire list of both attitudes and actions of someone who loves God and someone who’s paying attention to God. When you look at those things together, we’re looking for wise people who have a heart of service toward others, that have a high view of God, are connected with Jesus Christ, and live in a way that’s consistent with both of those things.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Those are so helpful categorically and the way that you’re tying them to Scripture really helps us to root these in God’s design for our relationships with other people. It’s easy for our primary goals in relationships, especially with our natural disposition tending towards sin, to be to have relationships with people who can do things for us, who we feel good about ourselves when we’re around them, and they’re happy and go-lucky. But there’s also an element in Scripture of having people around us who speak truth into our lives. Why is it important for us to make sure that we have friends who care enough about us to provide this type of accountability?\\nKevin Carson:\\xa0We need an extra pair of eyes. This last weekend, we had the kids out and we were walking through the woods in Missouri and the wilderness of Mark Twain National Forest. One of my kids said, “You know, I just feel like something’s on me.” I got to checking and he had seed ticks everywhere. They were up and down his back and he couldn’t see them. He knew something wasn’t right and something didn’t feel right, but he had no way of seeing them.\\nWhen we think about it biblically, that's why we need a friend. We need someone who's watching out for us, someone who's questioning our motives, someone who is carefully looking at what we do and asking good follow-up questions. Click To Tweet\\nWhen we think about it biblically, that’s why we need a friend. We need someone who’s watching out for us, someone who’s questioning our motives, someone who is carefully looking at what we do and asking good follow-up questions. The benefits are big. All of us need encouragement, the benefits of community, and of being a friend to somebody so that we have an outlet to serve as well. Those are a couple of key reasons that we need friends and we need to be a friend to other people. We don’t want to minimize your potential role in the life of another person, because just as much as we need it personally, we need to be able to provide it for other people.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0We’ve talked conceptually about what we would hope would happen in relationships. Let’s talk about getting really practical about how to pursue these types of friendships. What are a few suggestions going forward if we’re going to build these types of friendships?\\nKevin Carson:\\xa0One is to be the kind of person that you would desire as a friend. Take the principles we’ve talked about and apply them to your own life so that you’re walking in wisdom, walking in the Spirit, aware of the presence of Christ, and worshiping Christ. Develop the personal characteristics to become the kind of person that could help somebody else.\\nThe second thing is to cultivate these kinds of friendships in daily living. There are several practical ways of doing that. One is to not keep records of how people respond to you all the time. Let things roll off quickly. Deal with conflict as it comes up. Sometimes people say, “Well, I’ve tried to be a friend, but they didn’t do anything back for me.” I’ve heard people tell me, “I baked them something and they never bake me anything. I invited him over to the house and they didn’t invite me over to their house,” and it’s tit-for-tat, back and forth. We have to not be a historian and recognize we can serve other people. Serve often and creatively, and as we serve, check our motivation. Why are we doing these things? Are we doing it to honor Christ and to help others so that we have this others-centeredness as a daily lifestyle?\\nThe third thing is to be intentional.\\xa0Seek accountability and seek friendship. If we think, “Well, we’ll get to it when we can,” I don’t know if it’ll ever happen. Life is busy and for most people it’s too busy to expect that maybe hopefully someday we’ll get together. Follow up with each other. Be the instigator. When someone asks you, “Hey, can you help me here? Will you pray for me, or will you hold me accountable for this?” A lot of times we’re happy to not hold them accountable because we want them to do well. Sometimes, at least in my mind, no news is good news, so if I don’t ask I won’t hear what’s going on. We don’t follow up and in the process, there are times when the other person’s hurt, but even worse, sometimes they get caught because we weren’t trying to help them along.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0I wish these types of relationships were natural, but they’re so difficult. As you’ve been describing, this takes intentional effort for us to be able to pursue these types of relationships. Relationships in the church are often more formal relationships where we almost keep people at a distance. We walk in on Sunday morning and we say something like, “Hey, how are you doing?” Sometimes we become the biggest liars in those moments because we don’t stop and tell people honestly how we are feeling about life and how things are really going. What does a relationship like this look like in the local church, and how is it helpful in us truly caring for one another in the body?\\nKevin Carson:\\xa0It begins with understanding that our passion has to be for the one another ministries of the Scripture, where we recognize the necessity and we want to fulfill our role. I just passed somebody on the sidewalk on our way to this conversation who I taught several years ago. She greeted me and I asked, “How are you doing?” We’ve talked about this in class before, so 15 minutes later, I had her story and it was a significant story. Her family has gone through some significant hardship, and it was a joy of mine to be able to stop for a few moments, talk to her, help her think through it, say a word of prayer, and to be intentional in that moment and not to allow it to go by.\\nThe second thing is that we need to move our model of care down to life groups and small groups so that the church has very close relationships. Those relationships are fundamentally both for encouragement and for learning and applying the Word so that we know each other’s names, we know family members, we know major events that are going on. That’s one way to help with intentional goals. For biblical counseling, we can train and use advocates. We’re using those friends so that we get a 360-degree assessment of how they’re doing during the week. We as counselors have the opportunity to extend what we’re doing with them because there’s a friend here who’s willing to walk the road with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nRelationships\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'One Sinner To Another', 'subtitle': 'How the Church Must Speak About Homosexuality', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexual Sin 31', 'question': 'There are voices tempting us to speak grace without repentance, or speak conviction without care.', 'body': 'I want to look at just one verse that will frame everything I talk about tonight. Ephesians 4:15. Here is what it says, “Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ…” Let’s pray.\\n‘Father, would you come to us now and help? We confess that as we come to your Word, as we come to this topic, as we come to this hour, we do not have strength to do what you call us to do. We are not strong enough in ourselves to bring about change even in our own lives; much less the lives of others. We are not strong enough in ourselves to understand your Word, we are not strong enough to teach your Word. So Father, we come before you as people who – almost before we are anything else – are weak and needy and dependent. We want to confess that and ask for help. I pray that you would open your Word to us. I pray that you would open our hearts to men and women who struggle in great pain. Father, help us to know how to help them. Father, we pray it in Jesus name, amen.’\\nEphesians 4:15 is text about maturity. It is not a text about physical maturity. Usually when we think about maturity we think about physical maturity and growing up as a human being, but the kind of maturity talked about in Ephesians 4:15 is spiritual maturity; it is growing up into Christ-likeness. If you are going to grow up physically and be a physically mature person you need certain things; you need food, you need rest, you need somebody to take care of you. Ultimately, you need to learn a trade so that you can earn a living and support yourself. But if you are going to grow up spiritually, if you are going to grow up into Christ-likeness, you need a different kind of thing. Ephesians 4:15 tells us what that thing is that you need if you are going to grow up into Christ. The answer is actually a little bit surprising, it is not what you would expect. If you are going to grow up spiritually into Christ, Ephesians 4:15 says that you need a conversation happening in relationship. Isn’t that funny? “…Speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ…” If you want to be like Jesus Christ, you need a relationship with communication in it.\\nWe need to speak to one another and the way in which we are called to speak to one another is here characterized as having two elements, we need to speak the truth. The truth has to do with the words that we say. This conversation that happens in the context of relationship that leads to change requires true words. But then it also requires something else, it requires love. The truth has to do with the words we say, the love has to do with the way that we say it, the manner in which we speak the words. Speaking truth in love is what we are called to do. This is unnatural to us. We need to learn from Jesus how to do it because on our own we are warped away from this kind of conversation. On our own – on your own, on my own – we do not speak the truth in love. We are inclined to speak in other ways; we are inclined to speak the truth without love. We don’t just speak the truth without love, but often we will speak the truth without love and call it a virtue. “I am just gonna call it like I see it.” “I am gonna tell you the way it is.” Ephesians 4:15 says truth spoken without love is not a virtue.\\nSometimes we want to speak love, but devoid of truth. We want to say nice things and we want people to think we are kind people. As an exercise in winning their approval and having them think we are kind, we hold off on saying the true, hard thing. Ephesians 4:15 says that kindness does not make you correct. Men, we can be really bad and have no truth and no love. Harshness, stridency, dishonesty doesn’t lead to change. If we want change into Christ-likeness, if we want to grow up, we have to have a conversation that is characterized by truth in love. It means that Ephesians 4:15 is a text for the task we face at this current time. That is the case because this is a counseling passage. What is counseling? When you boil it down, counseling is a conversation that leads to change.\\nThis is a text about a conversation that leads to change and it is also a text that tells us what to say when we don’t know what to say. Have you ever thought how handy this is? Are you confused about what you should say? You don’t know what the right words are? The Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:15 gives us two touchstones. If you don’t know what to say, if you are confused about what to say, say true things and say them in love. That is important in our day because I think our changing culture makes it very hard for Christians to know what to say on the topic of homosexuality. There is a crisis in our culture; a crisis it is fair to say that is unlike anything we have ever faced before in our culture. Things have changed quickly. When we announced this conference a year ago, who knew what was coming? Who knew that? There are ordinances being passed across the country to require members of the opposite sex to be allowed to enter into bathrooms of the gender that is not their biological sex. The Supreme Court has made homosexual marriage the law of the land; in one really controversial decision a Christian women even went to jail over the whole thing.\\nThings have changed quickly and here is the scary part; they are going to change more. If you think it is going to get better you are not paying attention. As they change, Christians need to figure out what to say; what is their voice in this culture? Christians right now are listening to many voices that tempt us to speak words and it is hard to sort through those words and figure out which ones we should speak. But we are biblical counselors, it is our job to pay attention to the Scriptures, it is our job to have conversations with people in the context of relationship that lead to change. We understand the criterion for those relationships in Ephesians 4:15. Ephesians 4:15 – speaking the truth in love – charts a course for how we should do our work as biblical counselors in a world that hates our work. It charts our course about how to speak the truth in love in the face of what seems to me seven different voices that threaten to lead us astray. As I am looking at what’s going on out there it is seems as though there are seven different kinds of voices urging us to say words and I think these seven voices are wrong; I think they are faithless. I think they will cripple our work as Christians and handicap our work as biblical counselors. I want to try to narrow down what it means to speak the truth in love on the topic of homosexuality as we see how Ephesians 4:15 corrects the voices that are all over the place in our culture today.\\nSeven Voices That Threaten To Lead Us Astray\\nHere is the first threatening voice;\\nThere are voices tempting us to speak grace without repentance.\\nThis is the loudest voice that exists in our culture. It is what the culture sounds like; “Accept homosexuality!” “Accept gay marriage; it’s the norm!” “It is good!” “It is wonderful, love wins!” “Get on-board.” “Quit calling homosexuality sinful.” “Quit calling people made in the image of God guilty.” “Be gracious, quit being so mean.”\\nThere is even a whole group of people that call themselves gay Christians. One of those guys said this, “Same-sex orientation is in keeping with God’s relational covenant keeping character. That means we should understand it as a created characteristic, not as a distortion caused by the fall. By branding same-sex orientation as broken we are wrongly rejecting a good part of God’s creation and the final analysis then is it is not gay Christians who are sinning against God by entering into monogamous loving relationships, it is Christians who are sinning against them by rejecting their intimate relationships.” There you have it. It is not wrong to be gay anymore, what is wrong is to say it is wrong to be gay. That sounds so gracious on the face of it. It sounds so accepting, it sounds so loving. It is appealing; who wants to make people upset? I don’t. No one involved in planning this conference, none of you who have devoted your life to the gospel of Jesus Christ wakes up in the morning cackling through cigar smoke under a naked light bulb about how to ruin people’s lives. No one does that. Why do we keep saying what so many insist is so mean? It is because there is a conviction that we cannot get over, and it is the Word of God. God’s Word has not changed. It is the same as it always was, the only thing that has changed is our arguments that try to make the Word of God sound like the world.\\nThe thing that haunts me about the culture we live in, about the voices saying, ‘grace’ but don’t call for repentance; the thing that haunts me is our arguments don’t change the mind of God. Where is the love, where is the grace when we make sinners comfy on the way to hell? What seems so loving now will turn into great pain in the life to come. When you think about it like that you realize the call to speak words of grace without repentance violates the standard of Ephesians 4:15, to speak the truth in love. We are bound by God’s Word and so with all our hearts we believe Jesus when He says, ‘if you don’t repent, you will perish.’ And so it is with broken hearts that we say to people who hate us for saying it, ‘there is grace for you, but you must repent. You must leave your life of sin and turn to Jesus Christ.’ We cannot accommodate voices that tell us to speak grace without repentance.\\nThere are voices tempting us to speak change without Jesus.\\nThese are the voices that commend secular reparative therapy. That’s been in the news lately. Let me tell you what reparative therapy is; reparative therapy says homosexuality has a cause, namely, that you had a broken relationship with your same-sex parent and an over involved relationship with your opposite sex parent. Instead of the way it is, you are suppose to be close with your same-sex parent and you are suppose to develop curiosity and questions about your opposite sex parent. However, since that got messed up and you are close to your opposite sex parent, you develop curiosity and concern about your same-sex parent and that turns into erotic sexual feelings as you get older. You try to repair the closeness that you missed with your same-sex parent through homosexual acts; that is the theory.\\nReparative therapy also has a means of change. The mechanism for change in reparative therapy is a relationship with a same-sex therapist that is not sexual in nature, and so you begin to repair the bonds that were broken in childhood with bonds that are strengthened and recreated in therapy.\\nReparative therapy has a goal. The goal of reparative therapy is to get you to be heterosexual. If you are a man, they want you to have sexual attractions for a women, if you are a women they want you to have sexual attractions for a man and the goal is to get married and have babies. Be straight.\\nIt has an understanding of the cause, a means of change, and a goal. For decades, Christians have co-opted that approach – that secular approach – and used it as the Christian approach. There is a problem with it though, not one word of what I said is in the Bible. There is nothing about it! Not one thing. You know what that means? That means Christians need to repent because we sold as Christian something that is at odds with Christ, and it didn’t work. When what we called the Christian mode of change didn’t work, it looked to everybody watching like Christ didn’t work. This is why I am so thankful for ACBC and the biblical counseling movement because for almost 40 years we have been talking about the Bible’s sufficiency to understand and deal with problems. We are paying bills right now for Christians who didn’t think the Bible had enough good things to say about how to help people in trouble; now we are in trouble. What that does is it violates the standard in Ephesians 4:15 to speak the truth in love.\\nWhat the Bible says, what the Christian message is, is that homosexuality has a cause. Human beings are body and soul in one living in an environment and that whole arrangement is tainted with sin. Our bodies are broken, our souls are broken, and our environment is broken. And for some people that brokenness will manifest itself in homosexual desires just like for some people it manifests itself as heterosexual sinful desires.\\nChristianity believes in a method of change and his name is Jesus. He is from a place called Nazareth and He lived a perfect life and He died on a cross and He rose from the dead to take away all of our penalty and to give us power to live a life that honors Him.\\nChristianity also understands a goal for people that struggle with homosexuality, and it is not heterosexuality, it is holiness. Not one verse in the Bible tells you to go be heterosexual. No passage in the Bible talks about how good it is for guys to just be attracted to women, or to women how great it is for you indiscriminately to be attracted to men. Most of the time when that happens it is called lust. In the Bible, we are called to have sexual attractions for our opposite sex partner in marriage and for nobody else. Everything else gets put to death by the grace of Jesus.\\nThat is completely different, it is opposite from reparative therapy. Anything that we use to help people struggling with sin must have Jesus Christ at the center. Jesus Christ will not abide being pushed aside as people try to change their lives. That is the reason why I am glad this whole thing is blowing up right now, because it forces Christians to go back to the Bible and get rid of the garbage and start talking about Jesus Christ with people who need to hear about Jesus Christ.\\nThe whole problem is that Christians started tracing homosexuality back to a problem that was different than other problems that sinners face. We started acting like homosexual people where struggling with a special kind of sin that needed something a little extra special, and that is wrong and offensive. I want to say to you that I am a very sinful man. I am a profoundly sinful man and my lust is not more righteous for being heterosexual lust than is my brother’s lust for being homosexual lust. We need the grace of Jesus to change every one of us, and God help us if we ever try to speak of change without speaking of Jesus.\\nThere are voices tempting us to speak truth without the Bible.\\nThese are the traditionalists. They argue against homosexuality; they believe it is wrong and some of them think it is a sin. They argue that there is a certain way that life works best and that is with heterosexual marriage. They argue that heterosexual marriage has upheld society for millennia and they argue that a move away from heterosexual marriage will destroy the very fabric of society. Here is one person who says that,\\n“There are two fundamental views of reality, one is that things have a nature; that is a teleological ordered set of ends that inhere in their essence and make them what they are. In other words things have inbuilt purposes. The other is that things do not have a nature with ends; things are nothing in themselves but are only what we make them to be according to our wills and our desires, therefore, we can make everything – including ourselves – anything that we wish and that we have power to do. The first view leads to the primacy of reason in human affairs, the second leads to the primacy of the will. The first is not allow for sodomite marriage, while the second does. Indeed the problem is that the second allows for anything. This is what the same-sex marriage debate is really about, the nature of reality itself. Since the meaning of our lives is dependent upon the nature of reality, it too hangs in the balance. I make no case from religion or revelation in this book, only from reason as it discloses to us the nature of things.”\\nNow there is some truth in this. We just have to be honest; there is some truth here. Natural law, the nature of things does show us that things work best in a certain way. Quite candidly, one of the most obvious things in the whole universe is that men and women were designed to go together physically. We live in a culture where that is controversial, but that is one of the most obvious things that you need no degree to understand. Things do work rightly when they behave according to their certain ends and destruction does flow from violating that natural law.\\nBut here is the problem, so what if you want to be gay and if you don’t care about your physical health, you don’t care about your well-being, you don’t care about the kids that you adopt, you don’t care about the fabric of society, then what difference does it make to you if things work well a certain way? The whole logic anyway is do what you want. So, natural law and tradition just falls flat; it violates the standard of speech in Ephesians 4:15. It violates the call to speak the truth in love because it rightly observes the way things work without grounding them in the foundation of truth as to why they work that way. We are not allowed to refer to nature, tradition, or natural law as Christians; we are not allowed to do it. We can make reference to it and say that there are some helpful principles here, but we are not allowed to ground that in our call for change because there is no power in it. How much is the argument from design working out? It is not working out and there is no power in it.\\nThere is power in the gospel. There is power in the Word of God. There is power in the Spirit, who applies the work of Christ to our hearts. What this means – what Ephesians 4:15 means – is that we are not allowed to speak of marriage without speaking of Jesus Christ and without speaking of the Bible. Natural law makes some sense, but it is not enough.\\nThere are voices tempting us to speak conviction without care. \\nThese are the culture warriors. These folks know that homosexuality is sinful. They know that it destroys culture and so they fight. They fight to preserve culture by warring against the homosexual sin that they believe is destroying it. You didn’t have to look too hard to see these guys after Obergefell vs. Hodges. Here is one person,\\n“Because the court has inappropriately redefined marriage everywhere, there is an urgent need for policy to ensure that the government never penalizes anyone for standing up for marriage. We must work to protect the freedom of speech, association, and religion of those who continue to abide by the truth of marriage as a union of a man and a women.”\\nNow don’t get me wrong, I am sorry that the Supreme Court did what they did. I think it is a good thing when as much sin as possible is restrained, and don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to be arrested for talking about this tonight. I don’t think it is our job to try to give away as much freedom as possible, but neither is it our job to fight for our freedom. As we have occasion to get involved in public policy as every American does, as any person in a democracy does, we should do what we can. However I think we should be concerned when a Christian is asked by the member of the media, “Same sex marriage is now legal, what should we do?” and the response is, “Fight to protect your rights!” That’s not Christian. It’s not. It violates the standard of speaking truth in love because it fights for our rights instead of seeking to love a lost and dying world.\\nIt violates the standard of truth in love because Jesus Christ did not cause us to be born right now today to live in this world so that we could get rich, fat, and cozy in our 21st century America talking about our rights. That is not what we are doing here. Jesus Christ caused you to be in a time such as this because He wants you to proclaim to a lost and dying world that Jesus Christ saves sinners from hell. That’s your job. If you can keep the first amendment while you do it, good for us. But if we don’t, take the thing. Take it! It’s all going to get burned up anyway. And you know what, when it does we are going to get something much better; that’s the problem with the culture warrior mentality is you are tempted to settle for a lesser kingdom. Do you know how much better the kingdom is going to be that Jesus is bringing than 1950’s Americana? You don’t have to fight to keep you house and your rights. You can just preach the gospel with abandon and confidence that you are going to get something more than you can dream. And when we believe that, it gives us the freedom to love those who hate us by pointing them to the Christ who saved us from our sin.\\nThere are voices tempting us to speak behavior without desire.\\nThere are also folks in this group that call themselves gay Christians, but they mean something completely different than the first group; this is much different. This group says that homosexual behavior is sinful, they believe the Bible’s message that you cannot engage in homosexual behavior without transgressing the law of God, but they also argue that homosexual desire is not sinful; and it might even be good. One person speaking about this said this,\\n“What we in modernity have chosen to call a homosexual orientation or being gay includes much of what Scripture in the Christian tradition commend as Christian virtues. When we contemporary folks start talking about a sexual orientation as what causes us to form deep bonds of closeness with other members of our same sex, for example, quite apart from any genital sexual expression of that closeness.”\\nWhat this author is commending is the behavior is bad, the desires are good. Homosexual desire leads you to a close relationship with members of the same sex that are beneficial. We have to respond to that by saying that wanting close relationships with the same sex is not sinful, but neither is it homosexuality. It is not gay to want a close same-sex relationship. What homosexuality is, is when you want a same-sex sexual relationship. The Bible teaches us that behavior flows from desire. The Bible teaches that you are not a behavioristic machine who just flies on autopilot; the Bible teaches that you do what you do because you want what you want. Listen, I have tried to pay really close attention to the biblical counseling movement over the last 40 years, and one of the hallmarks of the contributions of the biblical counseling movement is that we understand that change happens at a level of depth in the heart as desires are changed that flow out to changed behavior. And if we cut that off – if we stop talking about desires, if we make it acceptable to hold onto sinful desires while avoiding sinful behavior – then we are going to get in a mess and we will violate the standard of Ephesians 4:15 to speak the truth in love.\\nNow, when people say this, when they say, “Ok, don’t engage in homosexual behavior, but also, you don’t have to change everything about your homosexual desire” it has a compassionate motive; we need to be honest about that. These are people who want to give a break to folks who have a daily and ongoing struggle and they don’t want them to feel that everything they do, and everything they think, and everything they meditate upon is sinful; they want to give them a break. They are actually looking for good news. But that compassionate motive will frustrate people. Eventually when they discover that if you do not repent at the level of desire, you will fail sooner or later at the level of behavior. We don’t have to worry that people are going to beat themselves up when they see that they are sinning all over the place because we have a solution for sin, we have a solution for sin in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And that constant struggle with sin which requires relief in Jesus is not something only faced by people who have homosexual desires, it is something you face, and it is something I face. And if there is no Christ to forgive us of our sins, if there is no Christ to give us relief when we think we can’t win in sin anymore, then we will be hopeless and despair tonight. We have a solution for sin in Jesus and we are all growing; we are all changing from the inside out. That is the path to real and lasting change.\\nSixth voice is one tempting us to speak ethics without ministry.\\nEthics is the understanding, the study of what is right and wrong; it is what you should do and what you should not do. That is what ethics is; what is right and what is wrong, what do you do, what do you not do. Ministry is different. Ministry is based on ethics and it has to do with how you help. Here is what is right, here is what is wrong, that is ethics. Ministry is how do you get from what is wrong to what is right. and I am saying one voice tempting us today is to speak ethics without ministry.\\nFor so many of our brothers and sisters in Christ who are trying to be faithful, this is the easiest error to fall into. Because these folks in their books, in their writings, in their teaching they want to emphasize what the Bible says, the true things the Bible teaches that homosexuality is sin. That is important work, I am so thankful for my brothers and sisters in Christ who defend the Bible against unprecedented attack in our culture. Yet, if all we talk about is ethics and not ministry then we will violate the standard of speech in Ephesians 4:15; we will fail to speak the truth in love. We will fail not because it is not true, but because it is not true enough.\\nIt is true that the Bible teaches homosexuality to be a sin, but there is more truth in your Bible than that. The Bible also teaches that Jesus changes people and the Bible teaches us how Jesus changes people. It is amazing the Christians that have run off to other approaches to help people who struggle with homosexuality as if whole sections of the Bible don’t even exist! There are pages, and pages, and pages, and chapters, and books in your Bible that explain how we can lay hold of the grace of Jesus to lead people to change. If we only tell people, “That’s wrong,” “Don’t do it,” “Quite it,” “It’s bad,” we will lead them to despair. When people want help, they already know what they are doing isn’t good. You make it worse when you say, “That’s not good” – well I know that.\\nHow do we help people? The Bible tells us about the kind of ministry in detail that the Bible commends. Listen to me, the integrity of our message is at stake in this brothers and sisters. If we believe that the Bible teaches homosexuality to be a sin, and if we believe that Jesus Christ changes people, but we don’t know how to help them, then the other stuff doesn’t matter. Do you know that? We will make a mockery of the Word of God if we don’t know how to do this. If we don’t know how to lay hold of the grace of Jesus, we will slander the Word of God and the grace of Jesus. So we have got to be people who know how to do this work; that is why we are having this conference.\\nFinal and seventh voice are the voices that are tempting us to speak Jesus without change. \\nYou know who these folks are? They are nervous Christians; they are some of you. Nervous Christians. One of the joys of my ministry is I get to travel all over and I get to talk with Christians and churches all across the world. I am going to be honest with you, almost every place I have gone in about the last year, I get off alone with a pastor or a ministry leader or somebody else and they say, “Alright, I need you to level with me here; can homosexuals really change? Can they really do it?” Like I am selling snake oil up here or something like that. But we get in this corner and they say, “Listen, I want you to tell me if it is really possible.” You know what that question shows? It shows we are listening to the world more than we are listening to the Bible.\\nSo, listen to the Bible. Listen to Ephesians. Ephesians 1:4, “…He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before Him.” Jesus chose you to be holy. You think you can change? Look at Ephesians 2:10, “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” There are good works prepared before you and before the people we love who struggle with homosexuality; good works prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. Do you think homosexuals can change? Ephesians 3:20, “Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us…” Can homosexuals change? Of course they can. Ephesians 4:15, “Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ…” You know what this verse is? It is a guarantee. You can take it to the bank; when you lay hold of the grace of Jesus Christ to speak the truth in love in this kind of relationship, you will grow up into Jesus Christ. You will change. It is a guarantee, and it is not anything magical; it is faith working through love in the context of relationship.\\nNow another reason people get nervous is because they are also listening to a sex-obsessed world and they think the only kind of change is the kind of change where if you are a guy who struggles with homosexuality you are obsessing over girls, but that is sex-obsessed, worldly, godless change. That is not biblical change. Biblical change is not heterosexuality, as we have said is not a virtue. Biblical change is when your life looks like Jesus Christ. And you can be married with ten kids and not ever have homosexual lust again and that is change and that can happen. And we have to say that that can happen. But that is not the only way to be like Jesus. You can be like Jesus if you do grow into a relationship with a married partner of the opposite sex, but you still at times struggle to put off homosexual lust, and every single time you put off homosexual lust and put on righteousness and purity; that is called change and you are growing. And then there will be some people who never develop heterosexual desires and they will live a holy life of celibacy; putting off lust just like the rest of us have to do. When they do it, when they fight for purity, that is called change. Change is what Jesus looks like, not what a sex-crazed culture looks like.\\nBut this whole thing of change is right at the heart and soul of the gospel. That is why we have to say, that is why we have to push back against the voices that say, “You can’t change” because when you say you can’t change that says more about what you think about Jesus than what you think about the sin of homosexuality. People can change because Jesus changes people and that is only false if Jesus is dead. But if Jesus is alive, then you can change and not only can you change, but sooner or later you will change; that is our message.\\nOur message is that Jesus Christ is going to come back; the clouds are going to tear apart and He is going to come for His people on a horse and it will be the end of all things. He will wipe away every tear and there will be no mourning or crying or death or pain and in that day, there will be no more homosexuality. Every person God gives us to help, by grace and through faith in Jesus Christ we can tell them, you will be different! You are not your sin, you are not your homosexuality. You are what Christ will fully one day redeem you to be. And for now we are on the way. We wait that glorious day when we all experience the fullness of the change Jesus brings; homosexuals and heterosexuals alike. But we are on the way and we stay on the way by doing biblical counseling. We stay on the way by having relationships with people where we talk and speak the truth in love and we preach the gospel and we say, ‘Jesus loves sinners, and Jesus changes sinners.’ Let’s pray.\\n‘Father in Heaven, the great threat to the gospel in our day is the lie that there is a certain kind of sin that Jesus can’t change. Father forgive us for ever believing it for a second. Father, help us to be the kinds of people who overflow with conviction that Jesus changes sinners, and then in love and conviction help us to speak the truth in love as we help those we love, our neighbors, our brothers and sisters grow up into Jesus Christ. We pray in Jesus name, amen.’\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexual Sin\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Fighting Lust', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 167', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexual Sin 31', 'question': 'Explore five practical ways to fight lust.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: Last week on the podcast, we talked about temptation to sin and the internalization of desire. One of the examples that I used throughout the podcast was that of lust, sexual lust, and sinful, sexual desire. I did not want to address the issue of temptation and lust merely academically, as though that’s all it is, but I wanted to deal with it pastorally and practically. On this edition of Truth in Love, we’re talking about not just the sinfulness of an internalized sinful desire, but how to fight it.\\nI want to speak to you very personally. We have people listening to the Truth in Love podcast all over the United States and in more than 50 countries. I know that in every one of those places, there are people who are struggling with lust, and there are some people who are struggling with lust right now. I want to speak to you with a great deal of urgency and very personally about how you could address this problem in your life if you’re struggling.\\nThe first thing I want you to do is to think about memorizing Scripture. In Psalm 119:9-10 it says, “How can a young man keep his way pure? By keeping it according to your word. With all my heart I have sought you; do not let me wander from your commandments.” This is written by somebody who is interested in keeping their way pure, and they know the way to do that is through the Word of God. The Word of God is a weapon for you to take up in the war against sexual immorality and lust. You can fight lust by memorizing the Word of God.\\nIf you’re looking for verses to memorize, this is a good place to start, but you also might want to think about verses in Scripture that have specifically to do with the power of the Gospel. One of the most important things that the Word of Truth does is it communicates that our sin is defeated not by our own effort, but by the effort of Jesus Christ in His life, in His death, and in His resurrection. The only way you know that is in the Bible, and if you do not commit that message to memory you will forget about it when the stakes are high with lust. You can memorize Scripture.\\nA second thing that you can do is talk to someone. I have talked to people all over the world who are struggling with lust, and one of the most common denominators that people who are losing the fight against lust share in common is that they are fighting all alone and not including other people in their struggle. It is deadly for you to engage in this battle all by yourself. I want to encourage you to find somebody to talk to about your struggle. James 5:16 says, “Therefore, confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another so that you may be healed.” The encouragement here is not to confess our sins to one another in any sort of sacramental sense, but as simply to say that I need you and you need me in our battle against sin.\\nYou should find somebody that you can talk to about your sin. You should find somebody right now. If you’re listening to this in the throes of a struggle, I want to encourage you to hit pause on the podcast right now, pick up your cell phone, and send out a text message or a phone call to somebody that you love, that you trust, and that you can open up to about this and get help from somebody else. Don’t fight this battle alone, but do it with somebody else who’s going to come alongside you and help you.\\nA third thing you can do as you wage a grace-centered war in the fight against sin is to come up with a plan. In Romans 13:14, the Apostle Paul says, “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.” Now, this verse starts out again with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The first and most important thing you can do in your battle against lust is to put on Jesus Christ. We don’t put on our effort. We don’t put on our guilt. We put on Jesus Christ. We remember who He is. We remember what He has done, and in recalling the Gospel of Jesus and putting on Jesus, there is power and victory in that.\\nPut on the Lord Jesus Christ, but that’s not all the verse says. It says to make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lust. Now, you can read that quickly, but when you slow it down and think about it, there’s a lot of effort involved here. This passage is an invitation for you to slow down and think about all the ways you leave the door of your life open a crack to make room for lust. Make no provision for lust. You make provision for the flesh when you say, “I hate it, I hate it, I hate it. I don’t want to do it, I don’t want to do it, I don’t want to do it,” but then you don’t seal off access to that sin in your life.\\nThis text is an invitation for you to think through all the different ways that you have access to fulfill the lusts of the flesh and then, as a further invitation, for you to think very, very carefully about how you’re going to seal your access to that. The reality is, one of the reasons that you continue to battle against lust is because you have not thought carefully about how to slam the door on your opportunities to do it. This has to do with making a plan. When are you tempted to lust? When are you most weak and most vulnerable? Talk to that person that you’re reaching out to for help and come up with a battle plan to make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.\\nA fourth thing you can do in your battle against lust is to pray. When we pray, this is the transaction we make with God to depend on Him and to ask for His help. You can pray. You can pray right now. You can pray with that person that you’re reaching out to for help. You can pray on your own. You can beg God for an ability, a power, His own power given by Jesus Christ, to turn from sin. You can pray to have a heart and a mind full of thoughts that are holy and pure and praiseworthy and wonderful. You can pray that God would surround you with men and women, depending on your gender, who are going to help you fight this battle victoriously. You can pray, you can pray, and then you can pray some more. I want to encourage you to stop what you’re doing right now, to hit pause again, and ask for the Lord’s grace to give you the people you need to wage war against this, to give you the grace you need to wage war on this, and to thank Him that in Jesus Christ, He has given you the resources you need to fight lust.\\nThen a fifth thing you can do as you wage war against lust is you can sing. This is one of the most profound strategies I have found in my own life to grow in the midst of any struggle with temptation. Honestly, I was struggling this morning as I was praying with a failure to forgive in my own heart and some attitudes in my heart about someone, and I immediately recognized it as a seed of hate and a failure to forgive. As I was praying for grace to turn from that, I started to sing about the love of Jesus Christ and about His provision for me in my life, and I noticed that sin begin to evaporate.\\nThat is no less true for me in that sin that I was struggling with this morning than it is for you and you sin of lust. When you sing, something happens in your soul. There are 150 chapters of singing in the Psalms because God has wired our hearts to magnify Him with music. One of the things that I’ve said and written in several different places is that you can lust or you can sing, but you can’t do both at the same time. You have to stop doing the one to do the other. If you are fighting against lust, then you fight to sing, and I promise you that you’ll be surprised at how the Lord uses that grace in your life.\\nIf you’re going to win against lust, you need the grace of Jesus Christ. You cannot do it on your own. As you depend upon the grace of Jesus Christ, these are five strategies that you can leverage to defeat lust and grow in holiness and purity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nSexual Sin\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Overcoming Sexual Sin', 'subtitle': 'The Most Important Reality', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexual Sin 31', 'question': 'The most important thing you can do in your pursuit of purity is get to know the living God.', 'body': 'Our world is awash in sexual immorality. Whether it is adultery, pornography, fornication, or gay marriage it seems that our culture is not only experiencing, but also embracing the full buffet of sexual sin.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps the saddest part of this reality is that the same problems, which plague the culture, are also strongly represented in the church. Most of my counseling ministry is spent talking to Christians who have been devastated by one sexual sin or another. The\\xa0 most desperate people I have ever known are those who have experienced sexual sin—either their own or the sins of someone else.\\nLearning How to Change\\nIn that context many people believe that change is possible. They want to be different, but they don’t know how to realize true change. There are many crucial factors that are part of the change process that would lead a person struggling with sexual sin to freedom from that sin. Here I want to address what I think is the most important reality. The answer comes in 1 Thessalonians 4:3-5 where Paul says,\\nThis is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality; that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor, not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God.\\nPaul says that the difference between those who are controlled by sexual sin, and those who know how to control their own body in holiness and honor is the difference between those who know God and those who do not. The people who live in the passion of lust are the people who do not know God. The people who are growing in purity are the people who do know him.\\nThat is a fascinating reality. The most important thing you can do in your pursuit of purity is to get to know the living God. It kind of makes you wonder though, doesn’t it? What is it about knowing God that is so essential to purity? I can think of three things.\\n1.\\xa0 When you know God you see his purity.\\nLaws always reflect the character of the one who makes them. All of God’s commands for us to be sexually pure flow from his own heart of purity. The God who calls us to purity is himself the very definition of that purity. Indeed,”God is light, and in him is no darkness at all” (1 John 1:5).\\nWhen you know this God who is purity and who is light you will want to be like him.\\n2.\\xa0 When you know God you see his pardon for your sin.\\nThe only way you can know God is by knowing his Son Jesus Christ. To know Jesus Christ is to know the one who provides forgiveness for our sin on his cross. Being forgiven is the most wonderful thing in the world. It means that all the things you have ever done will not be held against you because of the work of another.\\nFew sinful categories carry the weight of shame that sexual sins do. When you know God through his Son who provides freedom from your guilt and shame it is an unbelievably freeing reality. This is the kind of freedom needed in the lives of those struggling with sexual sin.\\n3.\\xa0 When you know God you see his power to change you.\\nAfter you have trusted Jesus to forgive you, you need to trust him to empower your efforts to be holy. The good news of the gospel is not merely that God forgives our sins. It is the further announcement that God empowers our obedience.\\nThe good news of the gospel is not merely that God forgives our sins. It is the further announcement that God empowers our obedience. Click To Tweet\\nFor people struggling with sexual sin they need the hope that their wickedness will be forgiven. More than that, they need the hope that they can actually change. Knowing God is to know the one who “trains us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age” (Titus 2:12).\\nKnowing God\\nWhat this all means is that when we are counseling people who struggle sexually the most important thing we will help them do is to know God. Of course they need to learn how to repent, be restored in their broken relationship, and a million other things.\\nAs we engage in this important work, however, we must never take our eyes off the goal of pointing people to a perfect God who loves them and demonstrates purity, provides pardon, and empowers change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexual Sin\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Biblical Sexual Ethics in the Local Church: A Necessary Course of Instruction', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'John Holmes', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexuality 14', 'question': 'The Journal of Biblical Soul Care', 'body': 'Introduction\\nThe Sexual Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s accelerated a shift in Western attitudes and public policy concerning gender identity, gender expression, and sexual freedom. Three main ideas dominated its public discourse: contraception’s ability to separate sex from childbearing, easy divorce separating sex and childbearing from marriage, and the call to eliminate all distinctions between men and women except those differences an individual embraces.1Jennifer R. Morse, The Sexual State: How Elite Ideologies Are Destroying Lives and Why the Church Was Right All Along, (Charlotte: TAN Books, 2018), chap. 2. For agreement on the sexual revolution and western attitudes, see Carl Trueman, The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self, (Wheaton, IL: Crossway, 2020), 22–34. National discourse on sex continues to impact American society’s moral and social fabric today, influencing attitudes towards sexual freedom and views on the biological family.2Bailey, Beth. “Prescribing the Pill: Politics, Culture, and the Sexual Revolution in America’s Heartland.” Journal of Social History 30, no. 4 (July 1, 1997): 827–56. Bailey attempts to document the “multiple sites of power, languages of negotiation, and critical structural changes” in which the birth control debate occurred. As one example of shifts in social acceptance, see Jason Rantz, “School board director to host 9-year-olds for classes on sexual pleasure, gender ID at sex shop,” 770 KTTH Radio, July 4, 2022, https://mynorthwest.com/ 3539919/rantz-school-boarddirector-sex-classes- shop-jenn-mason/. Politically elected Washington state school board director, Jenn Mason, teaches classes directed at 9-to-12 year olds on sexual anatomy for pleasure and safer practices for all kinds of sexual activities. Mason says “there’s no such thing as ‘real’ sex” because it is self-defined. The U.S. Census in 2020 showed that the number of children living with only their mothers has doubled in the past fifty years and that nearly one-third of U.S. children do not live with two parents, while almost half of all U.S. adults aged 55 to 64 no longer remained married.3“Families and Households,” U.S. Census Bureau, July 1, 2022, https://www.census.gov/content/dam/ Census/library/visualizations/timeseries/demo/families-and-households/ch-1.pdf; See also, “Number of Kids Living Only With Their Mothers Has Doubled in 50 Years,” U.S. Census Bureau, July 1, 2022, https://www.census.gov/ library/stories/2021/04/number-of-children-living-only-with-theirmothers-has-doubled-in-past-50years.html#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20America’s%2072.9,with%20mother %20only%20(21%25). Professor of Christian ethics at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, Daniel Heimbach, argues that sexual morality is the most crucial moral-spiritual issue facing our time. A cultural shift towards pagan morality, Heimbach says, will eventually lead to complete social collapse.4Daniel Heimbach, True Sexual Morality, (Wheaton: Crossway, 2004), 39. Heimbach says that sexual morality is the pivot point on which America’s cultural foundations will erode, leading to teen pregnancy, crime, drugs, murder, poverty, family breakdown, homosexuality, gender role confusion, weakened law, attacks on family life, threats to the sanctity of life and more. Christian philosopher and author Francis Schaeffer likewise lamented the legality of abortion, the entertainment industry’s promotion of sexual perversion, and the attacks on marriage and family life under the banners of sexual freedom and personal happiness.5Francis Schaffer, The Great Evangelical Disaster, (Westchester, IL.: Crossway, 1984), 20, 22–23, 101–103, 106–112, 188, 191. Schaeffer urged the church to urgently talk about these issues, fearful of the day when “all morality becomes relative, the law becomes arbitrary, and society moves towards disintegration.”6Carl F. Henry, Twilight of a Great Civilization (Westchester, IL.: Crossway, 1988), 15, 19. Francis Schaffer, The Great Evangelical Disaster, (Westchester, IL.: Crossway, 1984), 22–23. Francis Schaffer, The Church at the End of the Twentieth Century, (Downers Grove, IL.: Intervarsity Press, 1970), 15–6, 81. Feminist calls to “bring an end to God” and “castrate Christianity by abolishing [its pillars of] supermale arrogance: the myths of sin and salvation” indicate that opponents of biblical sexuality do not intend to remain silent.7Mary Daly, Beyond God the Father: Toward a Philosophy of Women’s Liberation (Boston, MA: Beacon, 1973), 71–2. Mary Daly, Gyn/Ecology: The Metaphysics of Radical Feminism (Boston, MA: Beacon, 1978), xi. Naomi Goldenberg, Changing of the Gods: Feminism and the End of Traditional Religions (Boston, MA: Beacon, 1979), 90. Although the secular world emphasizes sexual fulfillment and identity as “the essence of human happiness” that is justified by science, individual freedoms, and the need to eliminate sexual distinctions to achieve equality, the church is called to teach a different sexual ethic. An examination of Paul’s exhortations in 1 Corinthians 3–6 to grow in Christ and guard against impurity by avoiding spiritual immaturity and the folly of human wisdom demonstrates that churches should instruct biblical sexual ethics by teaching God’s design for gender, marriage, sex, and procreation to help Christians respond to the social narratives of gender identity, gender expression, and sexual freedom.8Carl R.

Late in the game, just moments from victory, they squandered the lead and lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. It was heartbreaking to come so close to one of their sport’s highest honors to see it vanish before their eyes. The team spent the off-season nursing their grudges, determining to do better, and wondering what their coach would have planned at the start of the next season to help them improve their game.\\nTheir coach was Vince Lombardi, and he too had been thinking about how to help his team advance their game. His plan, however, was a surprise to members of the Green Bay Packers. On the very first day of training camp, Lombardi walked into the room ready to address his team for the very first time in the season. Standing in the room full of some of the best players in the NFL, he extended his hand that held the oblong leather ball for which his sport was named and declared, “Gentlemen, this is a football.”1David Maraniss, When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi (New York, Simon andSchuster, 2000), 274. Lombardi then spent the entire season hammering away with his team on the basics of blocking and tackling. The instruction often felt so basic that members of the team would jokingly request that he please slow down. Lombardi was convinced, however, that the path to victory was found in mastering fundamentals that others took for granted. His conviction paid off. Six months later the Packers shut out the New York Giants 37-0 to win the championship game. This now famous account serves as a constant reminder that basics matter.\\nThe Journey Back to BasicsBasics matter in biblical counseling as well as in football. If Lombardi’s journey to recover the basics traced back to the 1961 NFL championship, this journey back to basics goes back to the 2015 annual conference of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors (ACBC). The theme of the conference that year focused on homosexuality. That was the year that Obergefell v. Hodges changed the nationwide landscape of homosexuality and marriage, and many Christian ministries were highlighting the sin of homosexuality. The difference between the ACBC conference and many other Christian conferences, however, had to do with the theme of homosexuality and change. Whereas most of the evangelical conferences on the topic were highlighting the ethics of homosexuality, the ACBC conference was emphasizing ministry to people struggling with homosexuality, and how to help them change.\\nIn preparation for that conference, I engaged in careful research regarding reparative therapy and read numerous resources on the topic. My concern was that even within biblical counseling there was an instinct to engage in integration on this topic and assume that reparative therapy was a biblical rather than secular approach to change. My research on reparative therapy led to many serious concerns about this secular approach to care which I have chronicled in other places. But one of my many concerns was regarding the secular goal of reparative therapy.\\nTo keep reading this essay by Heath Lambert in the Journal of Biblical Soul Care Spring Edition 2023\\xa0click here.\\n\\n\\nMore From JBSC Essays\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Sexual Ethics in the Local Church: A Necessary Course of Instruction                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Counseling Church Conflict from 1 Corinthians 5: “Purge the Evil Person from Among You”                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                A Critical Evaluation of Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                If He Does Not Listen: Escalating Biblical Counseling to Church Discipline                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Counseling and Heterosexuality                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                In Pursuit of Approval: The Sexual Revolution and the Degradation of Conservative Christianity                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Sexuality and Transgender Sin                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                A Biblical Approach to the Transgender Movement: First, Do No Harm.                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload this volume:\\nDownload\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\nSeries:\\nJBSC Essays\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

In subtleties we repeat the question, “Did God really say?” This question, first uttered by Satan in the garden, has caused more controversy and consternation for the human race than all others combined. As finite and fallen beings, we are tempted to see things as they appear before our eyes much more than we are prepared to believe reality as God has revealed. Sin causes a spiritual astigmatism upon our human condition where we may see refractions of light but are unable to focus our eyes on the world as God made it. We fail to clearly see the full purpose, meaning, and value for which we were created.\\nMore like the disciples than we care to admit, we struggle to understand the importance of Scripture as a guide for current events (John 20:9, John 12:1216, Luke 18:34). We are told to be armed with the Word in order to “stand against the schemes of the devil,” and to remain pure so that “we would not be outwitted by Satan” (Ephesians 6:11, 2 Corinthians 2:11, Ephesians 4:19). Based on Romans 1, we should have known that a normal course of disregard for God’s honor leads to futile thinking and darkened hearts, “claiming to be wise, they became fools” in the great exchange of His glory. When that happens, God gives humanity over to their lusts and those dishonorable passions lead in succession to unnatural relations of sexual perversion. When there is a suppression and disregard for God’s revelation of His glory, the natural digression is the sin of unnatural relations and of sexual perversion (Romans 1:18-32, Revelation 17 and 18). \\xa0\\nConcerned about the effects of our culture’s sexual perversion in the counseling room, I wrote an article in the Journal of Biblical Soul Care titled, “A Case for Religious Liberty in Soul Care” where I attempted to provide a historical perspective of a particular area where it seemed the church was vulnerable. “Inconspicuous to many,” I said, “religious freedom in the area of counseling has not yet become the primary focal point of social activists intent on eliminating traditional Christian values from American life.”1Journal of Biblical Soul Care, Fall, Vol. 1, (1:2017). How quickly that statement became outdated. Now clearly visible and brimming with attention, sexual orientation infects discussions of counseling, education, supreme court confirmations, and legislation. Even professional athletes are pressured to wear rainbow branded uniforms in support of modern sexual identity constructs. “If states are able to limit counseling practices,” I concluded, “attempting to address deeply moral, religious, and spiritual issues such as sexual orientation, then the state is demarcating the boundaries of religious freedom.”2Ibid. But how did we get here? The tide is moving at a much faster pace than I anticipated only six years ago. Why is it that conservative religious values are under such duress? Why is sexuality and sexual identity at the forefront of cultural discussions? Activists are not content with freedoms to pursue their own sexual perversion but are driven to seek more than toleration of their preferences—they are seeking approval, endorsement, and even sanction.\\xa0\\n\\nTo keep reading this essay by Dale Johnson in the Journal of Biblical Soul Care Spring Edition 2023\\xa0click here.\\n\\n\\nMore From JBSC Essays\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Sexual Ethics in the Local Church: A Necessary Course of Instruction                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Counseling Church Conflict from 1 Corinthians 5: “Purge the Evil Person from Among You”                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                A Critical Evaluation of Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                If He Does Not Listen: Escalating Biblical Counseling to Church Discipline                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Counseling and Heterosexuality                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                In Pursuit of Approval: The Sexual Revolution and the Degradation of Conservative Christianity                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Sexuality and Transgender Sin                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                A Biblical Approach to the Transgender Movement: First, Do No Harm.                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload this volume:\\nDownload\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\nSeries:\\nJBSC Essays\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

Gifford', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexuality 14', 'question': 'Biblical authority means that God is the One who has made us and thus, we are His. God is the one that identifies us and informs our self-conception.', 'body': 'My name is Greg Gifford. I have the privilege of being your lecturer. I want to do my best to get us into the text to introduce the topic in general and then to prompt you with a couple of things regarding biblical authority. If after this message you have clarity on biblical authority and its pertinence to transgenderism, then I’ve done something successful. That’s partly my goal.\\nI. Who/What Defines Us?\\nI want to put forward an erroneous self-conception that I have and do kind of like a brain or mind exercise. I want you to help critique a statement. I’m not being silly; I’m not trying to be minimizing or anything like that. I want to start to genuinely think about how you would validate or disprove this statement.\\nSuppose that I were to claim to you, “I believe that I am a giraffe.” When you hear that statement, I don’t want you to immediately say, “Hahaha, Greg, stop.” I want you to start to evaluate how you would disagree with me and why you would disagree with me (the basis for your disagreement). Ruminate on that for a second. Why would you disagree with that statement? What gives you the right to disagree with that statement? On what basis do you disagree with that statement? Think about how you would answer these questions if I were to say to you: “I believe I’m a giraffe. I believe that I was born in a man’s body, but am actually a giraffe. I oftentimes wonder if I should go to the Sahara and I should live as a giraffe among other giraffes.”\\nIn your mind you might think, “Greg, give it a break. Just chill.” But I’m being serious. What grounds do you have to disagree with me? What’s your basis for disagreement?\\nWhenever I put that forward to you, hopefully you’re starting to think something along the lines of, What is your means for justifying or falsifying something? Because if we’re just dismissive and say, “Well, Greg, you’re just being ridiculous,” okay, maybe I am, but then also maybe I’m not. Maybe there is a level of truth to what I’m saying. What is the authority by which I can prove something to be true or disprove something to be true. You may be thinking, “Okay, we’re starting out on a limb here.”\\nIf you’ve been keeping up with research lately, here are some of the things that are developing. It is newer that we’re starting to see a trend in individuals identifying as animals and then expecting to be acknowledged as an animal.\\nA picture from 2017 from The Telegraph shows a Norwegian woman who identifies as a cat and identifies with all of the behaviors that would go with that: hissing at dogs, fear of water, and cleanliness standards that would be indicative of being a feline. Some of it is just unusual to say the least. As of about September 2022, there was an Australian high school female who has done the same thing, and she is now expecting that her high school would accommodate for her identity.\\nThis is the question: How do we say to someone, “That’s not who you are”? What is the basis of your authority? That to which you appeal is your final authority. I’m going to spend some time unpacking this.\\nIs it your body? Is that the final authority? I would even encourage us as Christians to think that there’s something more authoritative than your body. But is it your body? Is that why you would say, “You’re not a giraffe” or “Excuse me, ma’am, you’re not a cat.” “Look at yourself in the mirror, Greg. That’s why I know you’re not a giraffe.” Because if my body is the final authority, then that is what I would put my ultimate and absolute authority in.\\nYou could identify with experience from other giraffes and say, “Greg, you don’t look anything like other giraffes that I’ve pet at the zoo. You don’t have that long, swirly tongue that wraps up my hand when I feed you, and I don’t. My experience would be that you do not look like another giraffe.”\\nI could begin to appeal to other things, such as geography or genetics. Reason is something that is often a source of authority in our lives where we would ultimately appeal back to our reason. In so doing we would say, “Well, it’s not logical for you to be a giraffe because other giraffes don’t look like this, and ultimately if other giraffes don’t look like this, then it seems to me that it would be reasonable to say that you’re not a giraffe, Greg.”\\nWhile these are interesting, and at times helpful, what I would argue for you is that none of these are the final and absolute authority, even your body. There are physical anomalies that we can experience, and yet there’s still something more authoritative than my own body. Even over my own reason, there’s something more authoritative than my own reason.\\nI’m going to put forward that the authority of the Scripture is more authoritative than reason, more authoritative than your experience, more authoritative than your body, more authoritative than your genetics or whatever geography you would appeal to. The place of the Word of God is authoritative over all of those things.\\nWhat then has made it possible for individuals to get to this point where we’ve shifted from it seems ridiculous to us that you would claim to be a cat to where individuals would claim to be a cat and now expect to be protected in that identification? I want to give you an overview of some of the transition of thought that has taken place.\\nII. What has made transgenderism possible?\\nWhat has made transgenderism possible? Well, first of all, if you’re a student of history, you can go back to the Enlightenment and you can begin with studying Descartes and how Descartes really cracked the door for us exalting reason. Now whether you love philosophy or not, that’s not what I’m here to prove, but what I would say is that our love of wisdom—our philosophy—has shaped many things unbeknownst to us. One of the greatest things that it has shaped is our understanding of knowledge and how we know what we know. Whether you believe it or not, Descartes started to exalt reason to be ultimate.\\nNow, remember Descartes was the guy that was questioning, How does he know that he exists? That was a crisis for him. In asking that question, Descartes then starts to find the solution and find hope. The hope that he found is, “I’m thinking about my existence, therefore I must exist.” “I think therefore I am,” if you’ve ever heard that phrase. It was set in the context of, How do I know that I’m here? I know that I’m here because I’m thinking about the fact that I’m here or I’m not here. He’s arguing for his existence based off of the fact that he knows that he’s thinking about his existence right now. I think, therefore, I must exist. What he did was exalt his reason to prove his existence and that opened the door for the Enlightenment, where now we see God lowered and man exalted and man’s reason being one of the key things that was exalted.\\nWe move then from an age of reason to a natural outworking of romanticism. Now you’ve heard of being a romantic, but romanticism is more of the idea of being true to your feelings and being genuine and doing that which is most genuine and true to who you are deep inside. Romanticism is seen as needing to identify who you are and not letting anyone stop you or letting the constraints of this world affect you.\\nMaybe you’ve heard of Rousseau. He said that man is born free, but is everywhere in chains. That is because the society is negatively hindering you, and in order for you to be your true self, society needs to acknowledge who you are, not constrain who you are. It’s a very seductive idea, isn’t it? That I don’t need school now to teach me how to act. I need school to confirm who I am and unlock my potential. Instead of me conforming to the standards of society, the standards of society need to conform to me. There’s a shift now and you’re seeing that gradual shift from reason to romanticism and romanticism to individualism.\\nIndividualism is where I am the one that is supreme and I am the one that acknowledges what is true and what is right, especially for myself. You can’t know about me. Only I can know about me. I have to tell you about me and you should support that. This idea of individualism has culminated with where we’re at now with expressive individualism where we want to not only be true, but we want to be true to our feelings and you to acknowledge what our feelings are telling us, our identities, our self-conceptions, and our perspectives about ourselves. We want you to affirm those things.\\nThis is a radical transition and it’s not true in other places. In Western thought we’ve moved from our reason is supreme to our intuitions and our feelings are supreme to now you must acknowledge and respect those and identify those as being true. How do you get to a place where it can make sense to self-identify in a way that does not correspond to your physiology? [This is partly hell.] How we know what we know and why we believe what we believe have changed.\\nLet me just pepper in some graciousness then. At times in counseling, we are not counseling a person who is overtly rebellious. There is a category of ignorant and deceived, as well. Does that make sense? You’ve lived your life deceived or perhaps ignorant of the realities that there are absolute truths outside of you, and now, for the first time, a biblical counselor is going to sit down with you and introduce absolute truth and absolute authority to you. What that should do just a little bit, biblical counselors, is it should promote graciousness in you. It would be like you going outside and someone for the first time saying, “That grass isn’t green. It’s never been green. It’s blue.” “What are you talking about?” That’s a worldview shock. It’s a worldview shock.\\nAre there individuals that espouse erroneous self-conceptions out of rebellion? For sure, there for sure are. But that doesn’t mean that all individuals who espouse erroneous self-conceptions are doing so out of rebellion. There are some that are simply deceived and ignorant, and I don’t mean that in a negative way. I mean that they’re not aware of or not knowledgeable of the fact that they are not the ultimate authority. They’re not the final authority. When you believe that you have the ultimate form of truth within yourself, other authorities are threats and potential dangers to you.\\n“I can’t work somewhere that’s going to oppress me,” one begins to think. “I can’t listen to my parents because they’re trying to hold me back and I need to be true to me. I can’t listen to my pastor because he doesn’t know about what’s going on inside of me. I need to break free of these restrictions.” That’s what Rousseau was getting at. He is the highlight of romanticism to where it’s, If you are going to be true to yourself, you cannot let society keep you in chains. You’ve got to break free of that.\\nIII. Transgenderism is a battle for authoritative truth.\\nIt is a battle for authoritative truth. What is the final authority in a person’s life? To appeal to this authority is what makes a statement, a belief, or an opinion true. Let’s talk about some of the ways that we do that, maybe even unbeknownst to ourselves as Christians.\\nNaturalism/empiricism/scientism\\nI’ve included naturalism and empiricism together. Maybe we could even include scientism (where we place too much of an emphasis on science). One of the things that I think was a blessing out of COVID is that we all have a healthy suspicion of science during these times now. Three years ago, I just had to say, “Research says…” and everybody believed it; but now I say, “Science says…” and everyone’s response is, “Nope. No. Get out of here, Greg.” We naturally lend towards empiricism, scientism, or naturalism where we want physical proof and we need some type of physical evidence. We would appeal to science or the scientific method for verification.\\nRationalism\\nThere’s rationalism where we appeal to our reason: “If it makes sense to me, it must be true.”\\nRomanticism\\nThere’s romanticism where I appeal more to my affections, emotions, or feelings.\\nWhatever you’re appealing to in order to ratify a truth or falsify a truth, that is going to be the ultimate form of what is your authority. The core component of transgenderism is an appeal to one’s inner person as being the final authority.\\nBut it makes sense. How does it make sense? It makes sense if you shift from external being the absolute truth to internal being the absolute truth. Some of that just makes sense, like, What do you expect is going to happen? When I dislocate absolute truth from being associated with God and His Word and I relocate it to being within me, then the natural result will be that it is disconnected from reality, from the truth of God in the Scriptures. At the core of transgenderism is a battle for authoritative, absolute truth. That’s the core. Who or what defines you? Who has the authority to define you? Do you define you? Most of us in this room might immediately default to, “Well, of course, of course.” But as I was thinking through this lecture, I was like, “Well, I actually think Christians do this on a micro scale. We self-define all the time.”\\nIV. In what areas of life do we find our own inner person as being a final authority?\\nI want to do this as an exercise to help show you so as to maybe cultivate graciousness in us and then to move towards: We still have to submit to a final authority. You and I self-define all the time, whether it’s good, bad, or whether you’ve ever thought about it. Here are some examples of the way we do that.\\nPain management\\nI hate the dentist. I almost have an ungodly fear of going to the dentist. Every time they say, “All right, you should be numb,” that’s like the last final words of my life. “You should be numb.” [imitates sound of fear] “Scale of 1 to 10?” I’m like, [in a whiny voice], “Ten and a half, 12, put me out.” You cannot prove how much pain you are experiencing. Have you ever thought about that? You can’t prove that and most doctors, if they’re gracious, aren’t asking you to prove it. If my dentist were like, “Man, I think you’re more like a 7. Can you prove you’re at a 10?” “I’m about to prove it, man. I’m going to get out of this chair.” The reality is that we do this all the time with pain management. You may say:\\n– “Hey, how much pain are you in on a scale of 1 to 10?”\\n– “It’s a 2.”\\n– “Okay, I’m fine with that.”\\n– “It’s a 10.”\\n– “Alright, we need to do something about that. We need to get you some pain meds and get you back to see the doctor.”\\nHow are you identifying that? It’s based off of your own perceptions of yourself. Before we grab the stone and sling it and say, “How dare you self-conceptualize? How dare you do that?” We do that.\\nGI issues\\nGI issues are often really difficult to prove and to have some type of evidence for. What is the source? What is the problem? Those that are on significant medications or those that are going through treatments for gastrointestinal issues (cleanses, things of that nature), oftentimes, we self-conceptualize and we identify about what’s happening within our own intestinal processes.\\nNutritional issues\\nThis is one that I give my students a hard time about. I see this and I’m being serious about this. A lot of them self-identify as having food allergies that they’ve never been diagnosed with. It might be a generational thing too, just to be honest, because I have a lot of 18- to 22-year-olds and I swear like every other one is gluten-free now. It’s weird to me. I’m not here to hate on celiac disease, right? That’s not my lane, but I do find it to be fascinating that you can self-conceptualize as having an allergy to a food and yet there’s been no proof of that. You have no evidence for that. It’s also interesting too because for some of the students it’s like a selective allergy until that really nice dish circulates around. Then I’m like, “I thought you were gluten-free?” He or she is like, “Well, I’ll be alright.” “Give me the brownie, you can’t get it now. Back off.”\\nI say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but yet it’s another example of the fact that we do self-conceptualize and we identify that as being authoritative. Maybe the food allergy is a California thing—I am in California. I’m not sure if you’re experiencing it in any other parts of the country. I’m like, “Just drink a Coca-Cola, like, come on.”\\nBut it’s at the point where you say, “Well, you self-conceptualize and see that as being authoritative.” That’s what I’m getting at. We generally accept that.\\nOther ailments\\nThere are other ailments that you might face. Think of joint pain or migraines. Oftentimes, we don’t need proof for joint pain if we’re talking about fibromyalgia, for instance. We’re going to accept that, generally speaking, you have some type of joint pain, and although I cannot prove that you have that joint pain—I can see evidences of maybe arthritis—but I’m going to accept those.\\nFor many of these areas, we don’t have proof or any other substantiation besides subjective realities, like pain or stomach pain or maybe even the symptoms of those, to verify that these are indeed true. We regularly accept such issues. We do this all the time. We could keep going through the list. We identify, we self-conceptualize, and then we see that as being authoritative, even Christians. Even Christians do that. Therefore, before we start to say, “Well, how inconsistent of a lifestyle must it be to self-conceptualize in a way that is erroneous?” just think that we do that to. It may be on a micro scale, but we still have a level of self-conception that is not always accurate.\\nHowever, with each of these, we would reject categories or ontological differences that do not correspond to reality. If a person were to say, “I have a migraine,” we might accept that at face value. However, if he or she were to say, “I don’t have a brain, which is why I have a migraine,” we would appeal to the fact that his or her body is indeed whole. He or she may still have a migraine, but his or her body is indeed whole. In this instance, the body has served as evidence that their inner sensations or perceptions are perhaps inaccurate.\\nTherefore, we do hold a level of you cannot change your ontology or your being based off of your self-perceptions. We do hold that still at this point, for now at least. There is not a category in which we currently accept a person redefining themselves based on inner sensations and feelings.\\nOut of these micro-areas of self-conception—and we would affirm it to be true—there’s not one category where we would affirm that you should redefine your physiology based off of your inner sensations, feelings, or self-perception. Then the question starts to be—this isn’t just true in Christianity; this is going to be true in general—Why would transgenderism be the one exception to that? Because of a shift in authoritative truth. That’s why.\\nIf you haven’t read the book by Abigail Shrier—it’s really written towards parents of young teenage girls—it’s called Irreversible Damage. She’s a Wall Street Journal reporter. She’s moral, but not a Christian. What she did in this work is she began to interview and do journalism on those who have identified as being trans (who have gone through some of the surgeries to make that so and then even some of those who have de-transitioned). In her work, she starts to talk about how gender-affirming care is becoming necessary now. Gender-affirming care is where when someone self-conceptualizes or identifies, then a medical doctor, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist has to say, “Well, that’s who you are. I’m going to affirm that.” She gives an example of a young girl who perceives herself to be obese.\\nHere is the scenario. She says to imagine that you were to meet with a 95-pound young lady, and that 95-pound young lady sees herself as being obese and asks that you would affirm that she is obese. Instead of you correcting her ideology and self-conception, now you need to affirm that she is obese and refer to her as such based off of her preferences.\\nShe goes on to describe the damage that would be caused to that young lady by affirming her erroneous self-conception (calling her fat, for instance; affirming that she’s not underweight, but that she’s overweight). The long-term damage of that is not going to be something that is reversible. This is the irreversible damage that she speaks of. If we would not affirm a young lady who wants to be viewed as fat while she is underweight, then what would be the difference about affirming someone who sees himself or herself as a different gender from what his or her body tells. Abigail Shrier goes on to say that the same could be true for race, body height, or any other dynamic. If you’re going to affirm a person’s self-conceptualization, where does it end? Where do you have to stop? Where does it become unrealistic?\\nThe point of her argumentation is that it’s damaging and that for you to meet authoritative truth and be corrected is an act of kindness and love and preventative help and care. You wouldn’t tell the underweight 95-pound young lady that she’s fat. You would say, “No way. You’re not viewing yourself accurately. Here’s who you are. This is who you are.”\\nInward confusion is met with the authority of reality as evidenced in the body. Here is the point about where we currently are.\\nInternal perceptions are still, for now, subject to external evidences. For now, but that’s slowly changing. Internal perceptions are still tethered to reality or to external evidences, but that’s changing. For some of you it’s not going to be your generation, it’s going to be my generation or my kid’s generation. I have three boys. One of them is in public school right now. It’s their generation that’s going to face this. When we think about how I argue for perceptions of myself, I can argue for many perceptions about myself that are still subject to external authoritative truth.\\nTo be fair then, we must see that the question of one’s existence still distills down to that answer of, What is authoritative truth? This is where I’d like to go to Matthew 17.\\nLet me introduce Matthew 17 and then we will go over to 2 Peter 1 in a second.\\nI want to read to you the account of the transfiguration. It’s a pretty phenomenal narrative here. When you meditate on what’s actually taking place and interpret it literally, it’s remarkable, and Peter’s going to give an account of this in his second epistle.\\nAnd after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. And Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.” He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.” When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Rise, and have no fear.” And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only.(Matthew 17:1-8)\\nHere is the experience: Peter, James, and John are with Jesus. Jesus is transfigured before them. They see Moses and Elijah conversing with Jesus. They hear the voice of God, the Father say, “This is my beloved Son” that terrifies them. It sends them into a “falling on your face” mode. Then Jesus comes and touches them physically and says, “Rise and have no fear.” I’ve had some pretty neat experiences in life. I’ve seen the Lord do some amazing things in counseling and marriages, through youth ministry, and through pastoral ministry, but I’ve never had that transfiguration moment. I can’t say that I can duplicate that in my own life.\\nPeter’s going to talk about this in his epistle. Go over to 2 Peter, chapter 1. As you’re turning there, authoritative truth is the key.\\nLet me highlight a couple of these points and then I want to tell you the rightful place of the Scripture and hope to demonstrate that rightful place to you from what Peter’s preparing to say about mount transfiguration.\\nV. The Key Components of Transgenderism\\nSelf-perception/conception\\nThe first key component is self-perception/conception. Transgenderism is actually “an umbrella term for the state or condition of identifying or expressing a gender that does not match a person’s genetic sex.” Identifying is your self-conception or your perception. It’s how you view yourself, what you view to be true. Gender identity, which is part of how you’re identifying, is a person’s self-conception of whether the person is male or female (how you view yourself).\\nPersonal Confusion\\nThe second key component is personal confusion. This used to be called gender dysphoria. Now we’re moving away from that term because we’re affirming transgenderism and not seeing the dysphoria as a problem. We’re blending cultural boundaries. We have parenting structures that are different. We have those who are coming from single homes and don’t have a male father figure and that affects them. When we think about the key ingredient of personal confusion through the environment of your parenting, it is a significant influence. Abigail Shrier is going to do some work on the type of home that you grow up in, and that’s also going to be the technology that you’re given access to in that home. It was interesting because YouTube was a huge part of persuading young people to transition and to identify as being transgender. That’s your environment.\\nEpistemological Authority\\nThe third is your epistemological authority. What is your final authority for what you believe is true? That’s it. That’s what I mean by epistemological authority. What’s your final authority? Is it your body? your self-conception? your experience? Those are the three components, but here is what I would put before you: the Bible, the authority of Scripture, when in its rightful place as God’s divine revelation means that all of life is understood through the lens of Scripture. I want to emphasize that, first of all, understood through the lens of Scripture. I make sense of the world through the lens of Scripture. But yet, there’s also one more thing. The Bible, the Scripture, when given its proper place, is not only the pair of glasses that I would wear to see everything, but it defines what I am seeing. It not only shows me, but it tells me what I’m seeing. God defines reality. Things are only accurate when God has determined them to be so. To know the world truly and accurately is to know it as God has revealed it in the pages of Scripture.\\nThe authority of Scripture means not that I just look around with the glasses and say, “What am I seeing here? What am I seeing here? Yep, yep, yep.” But it’s, “Tell me what I’m seeing here. I don’t understand without You revealing to me.” When we use the authority of Scripture properly, it’s telling us what we see and also showing us.\\nVI. Biblical Authority as Understood by Biblical Authors\\n2 Peter 1:16-18\\nThis is where I want to go to 2 Peter, chapter 1. This is a fascinating chapter that encourages me so much. It’s almost entirely about the Word of God. At the end we have, How did we get the Word? The Spirit carried men along. At the beginning (verses 3-4) we have sufficiency: everything that you need for life and godliness. Let’s go to verses 16-18:\\n“For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,’ we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain.” (2 Peter 1:16-18)\\nOkay, time out. What’s he talking about? Matthew 17. But consider the dynamics of Matthew 17. Peter saw; he heard; he experienced; Jesus touched him on the back and said, “Rise, have no fear.” It was like a multi-sensory experience. In fact, it would be hard to say, “Peter, I know you had the walking on water experience; I know that Jesus confirmed you by the Sea of Galilee (John 21); but it’s hard to get past maybe a better multi-sensory experience.” Peter affirms that, and he says, “We’re not making this stuff up. We were with Jesus on that holy mountain. We ourselves heard the voice of God say, ‘This is My Son.’” Then in verse 19, “We have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention…”\\nI’m going to finish this, but consider the gravity of what he has just said. Mount transfiguration is not as fully confirmed as the prophetic word. You may be like, “Well, that could be any prophetic word.” No, it couldn’t. He moves immediately into the Scripture and he talks about “no prophecy of Scripture” (verse 20). In Peter’s mind, he’s talking about the Scripture.\\nWhat is more authoritative than all of those senses that happened on mount transfiguration (eyesight, ears, physical touch)? What is more authoritative? The Scripture is more authoritative. Your Bible might even say more sure or more reliable. When we have this idea of confirmed, it’s trustworthy.\\nHow does Peter interpret a grandiose moment like mount transfiguration? He says that it’s still subordinate to the Scriptures. The Scriptures are still more trustworthy than that.\\nHow do you interpret your senses? How do you interpret your experiences? You do so through the lens of Scripture. Scripture is more authoritative than your senses. Peter says that it almost couldn’t get any clearer. Peter says, “We have a prophetic word that is more sure.” I didn’t have a mount transfiguration moment in my life, but I can tell you that there are times when I tend to think my senses are more sure than the prophetic word. Maybe you’ve been in that situation as well. “Lord, it doesn’t seem like You’re for me at this particular point in my life. It doesn’t seem like You’re near to me. It doesn’t seem like You’re hearing me.” Yet the Scripture affirms that He is for me, that He is hearing me, and that He is listening to me. My senses are not always accurate, and I have to bring them in subordination to the authority of God’s Word. I do that like once every 10 minutes. I’m just kidding, it’s more, much more. Do you experience wayward senses that have to be subordinated to the authoritative truth of the Scripture?\\nI think we all do to a certain degree. Then the question is going to be, How does Peter view this authoritative Word? He says that you would “do well to pay attention [to it] as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.” Continue to stay steadfast in the Word until Jesus comes back. We know that the Word that we have received wasn’t made up by men, but the Holy Spirit is the ultimate source of this book.\\nHow do you interpret your experiences and your senses? You do so by subordinating them to the authoritative Word of God. It’s right there in the text.\\nJohn 10:35\\nLet’s go to John 10:35.\\nHere’s something to note: the Pharisees and Jesus both see that the Old Testament Scriptures are authoritative and cannot be broken. Now, in your study of the New Testament, particularly the gospels, it would be fascinating for you to note that in the times when Jesus uses the Old Testament, there is never a dispute about what was actually in the Old Testament or whether it was seen as being authoritative. In fact, the Pharisees would agree. That’s often why it was a real stumper. What’s the greatest commandment? Well, let me quote from the Shema (Deuteronomy 6). Boom. You can’t say anything about that because you believe that the Scriptures are authoritative.\\nLook at an insight that Jesus offers here. When quoting the Old Testament, there’s kind of this sandwiched comment here. Verse 35 reads: “If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?” Jesus quotes from the Old Testament and it may even be set off by some em dashes in your translation. It’s like a parenthetical comment: the Scripture cannot be broken. It’s as if He says: “Do you believe that the Old Testament Scripture is so authoritative that it will not be broken? So why are you coming at me right now for identifying as the Son of God?” The Pharisees do not push back on the fact that, “Well, actually at certain times, the Scripture can be broken.” That’s not the point. There’s total agreement on the fact that the Scripture cannot be broken. That’s again why Jesus silences them. It is agreed that the Scripture is authoritative. How does Jesus view the Scripture? As authoritative, as unbreakable. In Matthew 5:17, He’s going to fulfill all of the law. Not even one small amount of the law will be omitted. All of it matters. All of it’s important. None of it will be broken.\\nJohn 17\\nOne last place. Let’s go to the high priestly prayer in John 17. When we talk about John 17, Jesus is praying for His disciples and then for future disciples. We’re seeing that Jesus is identifying God’s Word as being something here, and the reality is that it’s not only truth (lowercase t), but it’s Truth (uppercase T). In verse 17, Jesus’ prayer is that God the Father would sanctify them in the truth. Then He says this: “Your word is truth.” The full verse reads: “Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.”\\nJesus understands that God’s Word is absolute truth. It’s not like all truth is true and the Bible is true, the grass is green, Jesus is God, and they’re all equal in their authority, but rather the Bible is true truth. I love this quote by Francis Schaeffer. He said, “Christianity is not a series of truths in the plural, but rather truth spelled with a capital T, truth about total reality, not just about religious things.” It’s true truth or Truth with a capital T.\\nThe rightful place of the Word of God is to see it as not only the lens through which you interpret things but the lens that defines the realities of your life. Jesus is arguing and praying that God would sanctify them in His Word and His Word is the truth, the absolute truth. Peter says that even though he had that grandiose experience on mount transfiguration, the Word of God is more sure. It’s more reliable than hearing, than sight, than sense of touch. God’s Word is more authoritative than those things. When we come away from the Bible, what happens is we come away with a large view, a very high view of the authority of Scripture. You don’t study the Bible and come away from the Bible with a low view as if all truth is true (that the Bible is true and it’s just one more truth that we have out there, but there are many other truths that are equally true). No, the Bible is the final version of Truth. It is the authoritative version of Truth. It is true truth.\\nVII. Transgenderism is a struggle of authoritative truth.\\nI want to be candid. I’ve met with maybe two folks overall that are wrestling with transgenderism. When a person reaches out to a biblical counselor and the presenting problem is trans or a sensation that he or she is not in the right body, he or she is typically struggling. Does that make sense? These individuals are not hardened sinners that want to dig in and fight you over it. Hardened sinners wouldn’t be reaching out to a biblical counselor and are not interested in talking with you, in all fairness. Short of some trap that’s being set for you, you’re going to be talking with a person who’s struggling.\\nIn that context of meeting with folks that are struggling, we have to be able to say, “Look, they’re in a battle for what is going to define them. What is the ultimate truth in their life?” That’s a scary place to be, is it not? It’s a scary place to be. What will you ultimately submit to?\\nWhen this struggle is taking place, it almost feels like we’re having to be philosophers to start off the conversation to identify, Do your emotions and do your feelings ultimately define you? Is your sensation going to define what ultimately is true about you? Who gets to disagree with that? Why or why not?\\nBecause if I can get a person on board with saying, “I do believe the Scripture is the boss, the authority, the lens, Scripture is it,” then I’m cooking with gas. I can work with that. But I can’t counsel a person that does not accept God’s Word as being true and authoritative.\\nWhy did you reach out to a biblical counselor? I mean that’s the reality is that most of us aren’t in that situation where they went to a biblical counselor because they hated the Word of God and don’t believe it’s authoritative. It’s like, “You have got some issues, man.” They’re reaching out to us because they believe that God’s Word is authoritative. Therefore, what we’re doing is we’re sliding in God’s definition of you over your self-conception of you and we’re bringing them into alignment.\\nAccording to Psalm 100:3, biblical authority means that God is the One who has made us and thus, we are His. God is the one that identifies us and informs our self-conception. Your Christian identity is informed by the authoritative Word of God, you see?\\nIf I can’t slide in God’s identification of you because you reject biblical authority, let’s just not meet. I’m not going to be a whole lot of blessing and benefit to you. But if you’re on board with that thought that the Bible is ultimate, absolute truth—over your sensations, over your perceptions, over what you’ve struggled with your entire life—if you’re okay with saying that, then let’s inform you with how God has defined you. I think just for practical reasons that we as biblical counselors hold to the authoritative truth of God and then we appropriate what that truth is. Transgenderism is that battle. Will you define you or will you allow God to define you? If you’re willing to let God define you, you’ll see the restoration, the grace, the forgiveness, the mercy of the Lord. Just like any erroneous self-conception—hear me on this—I must bring that back to the authority and the truthfulness of the Scripture. Just like any other erroneous self-conception, such as: I’m not loved; I’m not valued; I’m not cared for; I don’t mean anything to anybody. Just like any of those erroneous self-conceptions, we bring transgenderism back to the authority of Scripture. What does God say about you and how can we live according to His reality?\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGreg E.

I consider myself to be a fairly engaged sports fan, but I couldn’t name the current favorites for any of the swimming world championships unless they just happen to be Americans who also won high profile races in the most recent Olympics. Aside from Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps (who is already retired), I’m not sure most Americans could name a competitive amateur swimmer until the 2021-2022 NCAA collegiate swimming season. What was once relegated to the almost exclusive domain of the summer Olympics, discussions of competitive swimming have dominated cultural debate for the first half of 2022, and the name Lia Thomas has been at the forefront of the discussion. Thomas is a transgender male-to-female swimmer who competed in women’s collegiate swimming events for the University of Pennsylvania during the 2021-2022 season after spending three years on the men’s team.1Robert Sanchez, “‘I Am Lia’: The Trans Simmer Dividing America Tells Her Story,” Sports Illustrated (March 3, 2022); https://www.si.com/college/2022/03/03/lia-thomas-pennswimmer-transgender-woman-daily-cover. Despite the fact that Thomas graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2022, the debate continued to foment as FINA, the international federation that governs the sport of swimming, issued a ruling that restricts transgender male-to-female athletes from competing in elite women’s aquatic events if they did not transition prior to experiencing male puberty.2The policy specifically states, “They are androgen sensitive but had male puberty suppressed beginning at Tanner Stage 2 or before age 12, whichever is later, and they have since continuously maintained their testosterone levels in serum (or plasma) below 2.5 nmol/L.” FINA, “Policy on Eligibility for the Men’s and Women’s Competition Categories,” 7-8; https://resources.fina.org/fina/document/2022/06/19/525de003-51f4-47d3-8d5a716dac5f77c7/FINA-INCLUSION-POLICY-AND-APPENDICES-FINAL-.pdf. If anyone was not paying attention prior to Thomas’ dive into women’s collegiate sports, the transgender question is now front and center of the cultural moment. And many Christians are asking the question, “What does the Bible have to say about transgenderism?” This essay will attempt to answer that question and more specifically set the conversation within the context of God’s design for sexuality. In doing so, this essay will conclude that transgenderism is a disordering of God’s design for sexuality through the physical body that He has created.\\nTo keep reading this essay by Evan Lenow in the Journal of Biblical Soul Care Spring Edition 2023 click here.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore From JBSC Essays\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Sexual Ethics in the Local Church: A Necessary Course of Instruction                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Counseling Church Conflict from 1 Corinthians 5: “Purge the Evil Person from Among You”                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                A Critical Evaluation of Bessel van der Kolk’s The Body Keeps the Score                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                If He Does Not Listen: Escalating Biblical Counseling to Church Discipline                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Counseling and Heterosexuality                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                In Pursuit of Approval: The Sexual Revolution and the Degradation of Conservative Christianity                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Biblical Sexuality and Transgender Sin                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                A Biblical Approach to the Transgender Movement: First, Do No Harm.                              \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload this volume:\\nDownload\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\nSeries:\\nJBSC Essays\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvan Lenow Director of Church and Minister Relations and Director of Event Services at Mississippi College.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

Seth is married to Karen and they have nine children.\\nAnd Seth, today, we’re going to continue during May Mental Health Awareness month, talking about some things that are very, very prominent right now in the world of mental health is sexual identity construct and if you remember from last week we talked in depth about some of the worldview, some of the ideologies that come out of the sexual identity construct. It’s important for us as biblical counselors to know those things, not that we ascribe to those or to adopt those, but we can see the schemes of the evil one to understand and know how we can take biblical truth and apply it appropriately for the need of the moment in the heart and mind of a person when they’ve been deceived so drastically. And this is so critical and I think you did a good job helping us to think through that. I want to continue in that conversation, we had a lot more to talk about last time. I want to continue that conversation because sometimes we may have a tendency to think, man, where did this come from? Like all the sudden now we’re talking about LGBTQ+, we’re talking about transgenderism and man, it seems like the world is moving so rapidly in this direction. Is this something that is new, as it relates to modern psychology and these sexual identity constructs?\\nSeth Leeman: Solomon said there’s nothing new under the sun, and so if that’s true, and as Bible believers we believe that’s true. Then even if we don’t know the detailed history, we know that there’s nothing new. So by default, we can say this is not new, this has to have appeared at some point in the past stream of human thought, but when we do the detailed study, we can say with confidence, yes, this is not new.\\nPlato the Greek philosopher, he has a work, it’s called Plato’s Symposium and in Plato’s Symposium the whole narrative is really a discussion of sexual ethics, and in this narrative that discusses sexual ethics, one of the characters in this work articulates a thought at that time, that is so similar to the thought of sexual orientation today. It’s this idea that there’s a, we might use this type of terminology today. There’s a third sex, right? There’s the heterosexuals. This is what we would say today. There’s the homosexuals. And then there’s the bisexual plus crowd, right? That’s the language we would use today. Plato doesn’t use that language, but he has those same categories. There’s the people who are attracted as men to women, there are the people who are attracted as women to men, and then there’s this other crowd that they’re drawn to the same gender. And what’s so interesting about that is that it is reasonable to believe that Paul as an educated man was familiar with Grecian thought. It’s reasonable to believe that he may be even himself had read Plato. And what’s striking is that he in no way feels pressure to adopt that type of worldview, that type of anthropology, that type of explanation of human sexuality. He rejects it all and he does what Jesus does. He reaffirms Scripture’s anthropology, he reaffirms the Genesis narrative, he reaffirms the creation mandate. And so, now this is not new by any means.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: And we see this level of sexual immorality, certainly in narratives of the Old Testament and in various degrees, the growth levels of sexual immorality on massive scale. I remember reading those as a teenager just thinking, man that just seemed like such a dark and wicked time. And yet, here we are living in something that’s quite similar. It seems disorienting to some degree.\\nNow, we’ve talked about how this is not something that’s new, but I want us to assess a little bit regarding sexual identity constructs into how the evangelical world is responding to some of these. You mentioned that Jesus, obviously, did not give into these categories. Paul certainly did not give into these categories of sexual orientation described in their day, nor should we as evangelicals. But we have evangelicals who are adopting some of these constructs, who are adopting some of these ideas of orientation using that as an ontological perspective, a description of personhood, a description of identity. So talk just for a second about some of the modern arenas where we see this type of language used.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: Based on what I’ve read, based on the studies that I’ve pursued, I mean the fountainhead that the most popular articulators of trying to take the modern sexual identity construct and somehow integrate it into scriptural practice and a scriptural framework on the transgender issue would be Mark Yarhouse, and then probably right second to him might be Preston Sprinkle. Both those individuals have written prolifically on this topic, and I could charitably say, I think that they truly desire to help people, I think they truly desire to come alongside these individuals whose lives are so characterized with brokenness and despair. And they so want to get, I’m saying this charitably. They so want to get that person connected to Christ, so much want to get that person connected to gospel truths that will help minister to their soul and help them as they live as a sojourner and stranger in this world. Yet what they seem to want to do is they want to flirt with, that might be the modest assessment, flirt with, a more aggressive assessment would be kind of accept and endorse.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, I was thinking of the word “adopt.”\\nSeth Leeman:\\xa0Adopt. Yeah, we’ll take that word. You said it, not me. They adopt this construct, the terms, the language, the theory, they try to build upon it in a Christian way, and I have found it to be very confusing.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Confusing, yes, I would definitely agree with that, but I think misleading as well. And the way I would sort of go about that and I agree with everything that you said regarding their desire, I’m not questioning them as people or their particular desire to want to help people. I think that’s very evident. I think these men if probably given their life, reputation, and everything to try and help people who they believe are genuinely hurting.\\nBut let’s hone in on Yarhouse for a second. I think Mark has done a tremendous amount of research and his desire is to help in some of these areas. He’s written a book called Gender Dysphoria, and more recently, he’s written a book called Emerging Identities, which I think is interesting because that demonstrates that term that I mentioned that he’s adopting to some degree those concepts. And when we adopt those identities at the forefront, now, we have to figure out a way. How does Jesus save someone from a particular ontological identity as opposed to how does Jesus save them from a particular sin or a group of sins that a person is struggling with, with the desires of their heart? And those are two radically different starting points. Yarhouse goes on to say in his most recent book Emerging Identities where he’s trying everything he can to help a person who’s struggling with quote-unquote gender dysphoria. Let me define that or maybe it’s good. Seth, why don’t you define gender dysphoria, then I’ll continue my thought with Yarhouse. How does he describe gender dysphoria?\\nSeth Leeman: Gender dysphoria as a technical term describes the discomfort a person feels because their perceived gender does not align with their biology, so it’s a term that describes discomfort. So, we have to be careful if a person has pursued transgenderism in some form. They may reject the notion that they are ever have experienced gender dysphoria. They find the entire path for them has actually been helpful. It’s been encouraging it. This is where they’ve found themself, so to speak. Gender dysphoria describes a discomfort with this disconnect between the way I see myself and the way my body is constructed.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah. And there are various ways, I think from a secular perspective or even a quote/unquote evangelical perspective as to why somebody struggles in that way, where there’s an incongruous sort of feeling about the way a person sees himself biologically and what they feel and desire in their immaterial man and Yarhouse goes on to try and explain the stressors that go along with gender dysphoria and how can we alleviate these things. And he talks a lot about engaging in different therapeutic modalities to try and help someone to relieve some of that stress of gender dysphoria.\\nI think that construct in and of itself is a little bit misleading. And I think this is where we see the methodology connected to the ideas. And I want our counselors to understand this. This is why this is so important really across the board is as he accepts those ideas, he never runs to medical intervention first, but what he does do is he says that medical intervention may be something as sort of a last resort where, you know, hormone therapy or even as it’s now called in a politically correct form, not sex reassignment surgery, but gender-affirming surgery. And to me, I just find that really unbelievable that someone who claims the Scripture as an authority can look at someone who’s struggling in these types of ways, with some sort of issues of sexuality, and think that it’s okay to alter their body in some way, that seems to be quite offensive to God as Creator. It seems to be quite offensive to several aspects of biblical truth. I want to; I mean, you’ve read a lot of Yarhouse. I want to get your thoughts on how we see this, not just from the secular culture, but how we’re seeing these sexual identity constructs sort of invade our culture. And particularly some of the things that Yarhouse has spoken on it.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: Concerning Yarhouse, I would say that a couple of the positives that I’ve gleaned by reading Yarhouse is that he has had contact and interaction on a scale that probably most of us that engage in biblical counseling we’ve not had that privilege if we want to use the term of interacting with the sheer number of individuals who are battling sexual identity issues or gender identity issues. And so I can learn from some of his experiences, and I appreciate the compassion that he brings to the table and a desire to truly help.\\nThe concern that I have, the more that I read Yarhouse is his deficient view of the sufficiency of the Scripture to address these issues. He seems to operate from a foundation that what we find in Scripture is not enough to really come alongside and help a person who is going through some of these struggles. We need the insights of modern medical experts. We need the insights of mental health practitioners, and so it’s this merging of some biblical truth with a lot of current thoughts on what is good and right and healthy for a person, and in the end, it’s, if we compare it to a musical instrument, it’s not a distinct sound as you read Yarhouse because, in one paragraph, you discern him standing in defense of the Scriptures. And then, in the next paragraph, he seems to be endorsing something that is completely unscriptural. And so that’s where the term that came to my mind, confusing, the term that came to your mind misleading. I would say yes and amen to both.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah. And to be fair, I want us to set alongside this a biblical understanding of sexuality. I think it’s good for us to do that as we talk about sexual identity constructs. And in a secular view of how we see sex and sexuality and those identities that now our modern culture orients itself around to think that’s become the prominent way that we see ourselves is through sexuality is quite different than a biblical understanding. So, I want you to help us to set apart a biblical view of sexuality that helps us to see the chaos that’s happening in the world around us a little bit more clearly.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: So, if we start with the Genesis record, what do we learn? Humanity is the unique creation that bears God’s image. God made us as male and female. And our purpose is, as our great catechisms have taught us, to glorify this God who has made us and to enjoy our God. And so, even if we just paused at that basic juncture, you know, my responsibility as a created being is to honor and glorify and fulfill the purpose of the Creator. The one that he has assigned to me, if we just start there and we compare that with where our culture is in our culture we would say something like this: The greatest point of your existence,\\xa0the greatest purpose that you have is fulfillment and the primary fulfillment that we need to make sure you experience as much of it as you can is sexual fulfillment. That’s a very different narrative than the narrative of Scripture. You know, the narrative of Scripture is that my greatest joy, if we just want to go from the teachings of Jesus, is going to be as I submit myself to God and in accordance with His standard, I love God and love others. That’s where my greatest joy is going to be. It’s in losing my life that I find my life.\\nSo our culture is saying, no, no self-indulgence, whatever your heart craves, go after it. And if someone gets between you and what your heart craves, they’re potentially abusive. They’re harming you, you know, so we have a negative view of the preacher who preaches against sexual sin or preaches against modern trans ideas, right? We’ve got a negative view of that. We’ve got a negative view in our culture of a parent who does something less than affirm their three-year-old or four-year-old. Our culture has gone off script, our culture is no longer following the biblical narrative. The biblical narrative: I exist for God, I exist primarily to worship God, and my enjoyment and my fulfillment is a secondary byproduct of that first commitment. It’s when I have a well-ordered life as God defines a well-ordered life that I’ll truly have joy and satisfaction and true fulfillment. And true fulfillment and fruition of what God has granted to me. That’ll be found there. So, God has created us as image bearers. When it comes to our sexuality God said be fruitful and multiply. And so I would say, I want to say this humbly that when it comes to my masculinity, it’s normative to expect that as I grow and mature and reach a full robust age that I would find myself a wife, right? He that finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor with the Lord. And so, God has given me a desire, procreative desire, desire for sexual intimacy, and God has in bringing Adam and Eve together, he has shown us the way, here’s how you steward this desire.\\nNow, if you do not find yourself in a biblical marriage doesn’t mean that you’re less of a human, less of a person. We can point throughout history to sorts of fully human, fully satisfied heroes of our faith that were single. And so, we’re not trying to exalt marriage as being greater than singleness. But we’re not being honest with the narrative of Scripture if we’re not recognizing that God made man and woman complementary and God designed for them to come together and form families and that the gift of their sexuality, first and foremost, it’s for Him, but then on a secondary society level, it’s for each other. It’s 1 Corinthians 7. My body is for the pleasure, satisfaction, and fulfillment of my wife and her desires, and her body is for me and there should be that selfless orientation. So you’ve got this biblical construct, I don’t really like that term but it’s the way that God has ordered things. You have this biblical construct. The way that we’re supposed to steward our sexual desires and passions it’s limited, yet in those limitations, there’s great freedom. And then we’ve got the narrative of the serpent, which is there are no boundaries, really, the only boundary is when someone sets up a boundary.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: And that leads to death and destruction, death and destruction, instability, chaos. We see that throughout the narrative of Scripture consistently. Now, I do want to talk about this because I think we sort of have a construct in our evangelical world that, you know, of heterosexuality. And I wish we had time; we just don’t to go into the history of, I think that’s where a lot of evangelicals in the 50s, 60s, 70s, when the DSM was homosexuality as a disorder. And they just wanted people to be heterosexual, but as I think about the modern sexual identity constructs, what are the negative implications for quote-unquote heterosexuals?\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: Well, the first negative is just this idea that I’m okay.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: If you’re heterosexual.\\nSeth Leeman: If I’m heterosexual, I’m okay. What does Scripture say? Scripture says I’m a sinner. So, according to Scripture and according to the reality that I’m a sinner, I’m going to be sinning in this area of my sexuality. And I think that where are where our culture has been, not so much today, but where it has been, there was this idea that, well, at least I’m not gay right within the church, right? Because they’re bad, they’re sinners, they need change. But you know, I just look at pornography, right? Or I’ve just been guilty of fornication during my college years, right? I just lust when I see other women in the church that I find attractive. We give ourselves a pass on all these serious categories of sin because we’ve put it under the umbrella of heterosexuality, and heterosexuality is good. I don’t even like the term. Men in marriage, loving well their wife that is good. Praise God that is good. It is honorable. The bed is undefiled. Praise God for that, but the other deviations from that that occur with the opposite gender. We’ve got all sorts of categories. That’s fornication. That’s adultery. That’s fill-in-the-blank. These are sins that separate us from God that break our fellowship. These are sins for which Christ has to atone. And so that’s one of the immediate dangers, the immediate dangers when you’re not struggling with some of these things. I don’t struggle with my sexual identity. I don’t struggle with my gender identity. Then, I’m good.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, we become blind to our own sin.\\nSeth Leeman: Right, you know,\\xa0I’m a level A Christian. And then, there’s these level B people over here. They’re struggling with sin, but at least I don’t. So that would be one consequence that leaps off the page. The second consequence would, again, when it comes to walking in purity, it’s not just confusing. It’s misleading. It’s this idea of how do I live in a way that’s pleasing to God? I’m to be holy in my sexuality, and that’s different than I’m to be a heterosexual, or I’m to be a homosexual, or I’m to be a bisexual. I’m to be holy, and when we use these non-biblical terms, it muddies the water. What does holiness look like?\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: And I think those constructs, even the religionized ones, like heterosexuality, they become the lens by which we see whether we’re good or bad, and the idea that you’re bringing up is holiness, is we see ourselves in our sexuality as good or evil before God. And that’s the right place that we should see ourselves.\\nAnd now, we’ve talked a lot about the sexual identity constructs and why they should be rejected and the ideas behind them and that sort of thing. But these things certainly are appearing all over the place in our churches. I have questions from youth pastors all the time. I’ve got a kid who’s claiming he’s transgender, and we’re going to camp. What should I do? But we’re having, you know, people asking about using certain bathrooms, or we have people who are coming for counsel, and how are we addressing these? I want you, Seth, with the backdrop of the ideas of the sexual identity construct, how much it’s pervading our common culture, even in the church, I want us to talk about how we can lead a counselee away from this type of thinking with the Scriptures?\\nSeth Leeman: Something that I’ve done in several counseling situations is present to the counselee the position of Scripture. So, what do the Scriptures say about anthropology? What do the Scriptures say about hamartiology, sin? What does Scripture say about sanctification and soteriology? So I want them to understand what the Christian religion is all about because the Christian religion gives us an explanation of why do I struggle with these sinful passions and who am I really am. What is my responsibility before God? And how do I make things right with God and how do I live and overcome temptation, and how do I pursue a life that is fulfilling and satisfying and that glorifies God? We want our counselees to understand, in a really robust way, the Christian message, the Christian call. So I’m picturing like a good angel on someone’s shoulder that’s saying to the counselee. Come follow me. Come into this world, live in this reality, order yourself in accordance with the world that God has constructed the way things really are, order yourself in accordance with truth.\\nAt the same time, we’ll set in parallel this idea that we currently live in a culture and in a moment in time where there is a different way being presented, there’s a different religion, it has different creeds, it has different holy books, it has different liturgies.\\nDale Johnson: And values, yeah.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: Values, and at the end of the day, both have to be accepted by faith. Both, at the end of the day, you’re submitting and listening to an authority, you can submit and listen to the authority of God, or you can submit and listen to the ideas of man, which with every generation, every 4-5 that pass have drastic shifts, massive movements in thought, and explanations of what is a good life and why are certain things broken and how do we fix it? But that’s been really helpful, particularly amongst counseling younger people because sometimes they come to the counseling table thinking this, they come with the default that science is authoritative and that Scripture is suggestive. And if I never deal with that and I rush straight into, well, here’s what Jesus said about sexuality. You know, here’s what Moses wrote about sexuality. Here are your options moving forward. Here’s how we can help you as a church, which is all good, but those things need to be covered, but if I don’t deal with the deeper authority, it comes back to pointing out idols. If I don’t deal with the idols of our day, in addition to the idols that are functioning within my counselee’s heart, if I don’t address that robustly, I’m likely going to be guilty of treating a wound artificially, like I didn’t quite get out the gangrene. And so, a few months after that person has left the counseling relationship, the accountability and structure that comes with counseling, they’re back taking the temperature of the room that we all live in, so to speak.\\nDale Johnson: And I think it’s helpful is when you do what you just described, I think we’re helping them to see that the Bible explains why they find themselves in unbelievable turmoil, why they find themselves walking in an unstable way, why things are wrestling with in them. And nothing has helped to explain that up to this point. And I think the Bible, even in their sin, even in our sin, as we walk in sin at times, the Bible explains how we got there, and it gives a reality of why we’re feeling the things that we’re feeling, why we feel sort of upended and disoriented. And I think that can be helpful and somewhat stabilizing to a person that it gives an explanation as to what they’re wrestling with.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: If I could speak to that briefly, I’ve recently experienced that. I’m thinking of two specific occasions. And these were Christian young people, young people that had true Christian professions and seemed to have a meaningful relationship with God. And as I was sitting with them and providing counsel to them, doing a little bit of what I just described, their response to the presentation of, here’s the narrative you’ve been hearing on YouTube. Here’s what you’ve been seeing it. You know the gay-straight alliance club at school. Here’s what that musician or that artist they’ve been espousing this, but here’s what Scripture says and presenting the two different worldviews, and whose voice you’re going to listen to? The response from the Christian counselee is one of relief. It’s like, ah, now my counseling supervisor was Randy Patten, and Randy Patten would say, if they’re not a Christian, you’re really not counseling; it’s evangelism. And so, I’m not suggesting that every time we do this, you know, here’s the worldview of Scripture. And here’s the current diagnosis of our worldview. That every single person that we sit in front of is going to find relief in the presentation of Scripture, but it is true. It really is true, and it’s sufficient, and it makes sense. And it’s robust and it’s so much fuller and thicker and deeper than anything the world’s offering. And I think that we need to become more confident in that.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I want to talk about that hope of Scripture, and that’ll be the last thing we’re running a little long today, but I do at some point, Seth, I want to bring you back to talk about the narrative that’s happening right now, because what we’re hearing in the mental health world is we have to get, you know, these folks are struggling with their gender identity. We have to get them to different places, whether that be hormonal therapy or different therapeutics, or the general firming quote-unquote surgery. And we’re not asking the question, is that truly bringing people to a disposition of help? And I think there’s a whole narrative of study that the secular world is a little bit nervous about those who are wanting to detransition. Those who, you know, what is their mental health look like afterward and there’s some information coming out about that, that’s not favorable to the secular world. So I think that raises the issue is they’re putting all their eggs in a basket of hope and saying that in the end, maybe that’s not too hopeful.\\nSo, what I want you to do is to help us to understand what hope Scripture provides for folks who are caught into this struggle with their sexuality and with their, as they see it, their identity.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: One of my favorite New Testament passages is 1 Corinthians chapter 6, the context of 1 Corinthians chapter 6, he’s dealing with this idea that there at the church at Corinth believers were taking believers before the secular judges instead of settling things from within the church, and as he’s developing the flow of that thought there’s just a few verses that are so deep and rich and ultimately, hopeful starts in verse 9 go through verse 11, it says this, “do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived, neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves nor the greedy, nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.”\\nFirst, that doesn’t sound very hopeful or encouraging. But it is in this sense when we treat these sexual matters as they truly are, sin, they’re sin, and nearly everything that’s being described here and 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, not everything, but nearly everything is categories of sin within the realm of sexuality. When we deal with it as sin, when we give that bad news, that bad news prepares us for the good news. You’re giving an accurate diagnosis; you’re explaining to the person that one of the reasons that they’re experiencing guilt, shame, they’re suffering on a mental, emotional, and spiritual level is that’s what sin does. sin when it is finished brings forth death, because life comes from God, So that Scripture then what gets really hopeful as Paul says this, “And such were some of you,” so I don’t have to be defined by my sin. I don’t have to live in a perpetual state of guilt. I don’t have to carry shame because of what Jesus Christ has done on the cross because He paid for our sins. Because by His spirit in the New Covenant, there is a power available to me to live in accordance with God’s holy law because all of that is mine as a believer in Jesus Christ. I can say I’m a new man. I’m a new woman. I can leave that baggage behind, such were some of you, and I love these positive terms. “You were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the spirit of our God.” And I end with this, the Bible, the gospel, the message of Jesus Christ is perfectly suited to help sinners and that’s what’s so hopeful.\\nDale Johnson: And that is stabilizing. It’s life-giving. It is hopeful. It gives us an outlook of living life in relation to our God, and it’s settling to the soul. That is the hope that we have in Scripture. Well done, Seth.\\nThis is the beginning of lots of conversations. I want to give us permission to talk about these things that are certainly pervasive in our culture, and we, as biblical Christians, need to start thinking deeply about these things and addressing them from a Biblical perspective. Seth, you’re helping us to do that in a lot of different ways. I’m excited about your work and your doctoral program. I can’t wait for some of that to be completed and finished, and I look forward to you addressing some of this in the days ahead.

Seth is new to our listeners, but I’m so excited to introduce all of you to him. Seth is the senior pastor of Noblesville Baptist Church in Noblesville, Indiana where he has served for 14 years. He’s a graduate of Faith Bible Seminary with an M.Div, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary with a ThM, and he’s currently a Ph.D. student here at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He’s also an ACBC-certified counselor, and Seth is married to Karen, and they have nine children. Seth, I’m so glad and delighted that you are here talking about this subject of sexuality, sexual identity constructs, and how we as counselors can think thoroughly through the worldview behind it. So, thank you for being here.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: It’s great to be here.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, you’ve done a lot of work in your Ph.D. studies here, and I do think it’s important, we have a lot of people saying in the biblical counseling world how to address these types of issues that would sexuality and the ideas homosexuality and transgenderism, and how do we approach these things and their debates about you know, should we use their preferred pronouns and all this kind of stuff.\\nI think as we think through some of these issues, we definitely don’t want to neglect biblical truth as it relates to putting off and putting on, and how we address sin in the hearts of people. That’s not what we’re saying. What we’re trying to say is we want to look at a worldview that’s behind some of this. So, we’re not neglecting any of that. We assume that’s true, that’s a biblical approach of how we think about change, but we also want to make sure that we’re applying biblical truth with precision. And I think that’s a part of what you’re going to help us to do today. As we talk through these sexual identity constructs, we’re going to try to address the worldview from which these things are coming, and as we understand this worldview that’s behind the sexual identity construct, we can understand why it’s dangerous. We can understand how biblical truth contradicts it and how we can apply as counselors biblical truth to teenagers and adults who are wrestling with this level of sin in their heart. So, let’s just start here. Why is modern psychology’s sexual identity construct so dangerous?\\nSeth Leeman:\\xa0I would answer that question by going back to Scripture and the Scripture that comes to my mind, Colossians chapter 2, where the Apostle Paul warns us about this idea that we could be taken captive and let away from Christ through philosophy and vain deceit. And so the sexual identity construct, as I understand it today, birthed by modern psychology, it’s false. It is a bag of lies, and so it’s destructive, it hurts people, it ruins people. And so, that’s why I think that we need to be really careful and critical. We need to expose it. We need to tear it down and then build back up a biblical edifice.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, I think for us being able to understand conceptually what the Bible describes as sexuality. What’s healthy sexuality, what’s good, what’s God’s design relative to sexuality? It’s going to be so critical, and I think we wrestle with that. But what we see is people becoming confused, people becoming deceived about this whole sexual identity construct. What I want you to do now is describe a little bit about what is so unbiblical about modern psychology’s view of sexual identity construct.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman:\\xa0I think for the listener, when you’re thinking about the sexual identity construct, I disagree with it for three primary reasons. First, there’s an epistemological claim. So, in the current modern sexual identity construct, the idea is that you discover truth by listening to your heart, you discover truth through your own personal experience, you discover truth by having a group of people around you affirm your feelings, your identity, the behaviors that you’d like to pursue. And as we go to Scripture, that’s not a biblical epistemology. Biblical epistemology, a biblical way of coming to know anything, is to first fear the Lord, to fear the Lord, and listen to what God has said. And so, the modern sexual identity construct rejects biblical anthropology, creates completely new categories of personhood. It exalts the gift of sexuality, and it centralizes it, that this area of sexuality becomes the controlling factor, the primary lens through which I see myself versus it being a part of being a man or woman made in the image of God, something that I have to steward carefully in the manner in which God has instructed me to steward it. And so epistemologically, I have deep concerns about the modern sexual identity construct.\\nThen you move beyond that, and you get just into the street of biblical instruction. You know, what does the Bible say? And what the Bible says about how I identify myself, how I see myself, how I steward myself, how Scripture speaks of that is so different than this modern construct, and so, there’s epistemological concerns. There’s just straightforward concerns comparing what the Bible says to the claims of the sexual identity construct. And then there’s what I would call residual concerns. If you embrace the sexual identity construct, you have very little hope for change. If you deal with sexuality, as Scripture deals with it, you have tremendous hope for change. You have tremendous hope because God’s Word is very equipped to handle sin. The gospel is perfectly suited to offer cleansing, forgiveness, an opportunity for a new start, fresh direction, the power to live in victory and have joy and meaning. So I have these deep concerns, and I think that’s something that we need to talk about a little bit more. We need to talk about the construct more than just saying, this is bad. You can’t feed this, you can’t pursue this from the practical level, I think we do need to spend some time sitting in the theoretical.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now, what I want you to do, Seth in just a minute is I want you to describe where some of these ideas came from historically when we look at modern psychology from a historical perspective. The first thing I think would be important is for us to lay down what it is that we’re talking about when we describe sexual identity construct. To some people that may be a new idea. You’ve heard LGBTQ ideas, you’ve heard about transgenderism certainly been in the news a lot in recent days, and how rapidly our culture is sort of moving in this leftward direction. It’s really interesting to me. I think a couple of background pieces here would be helpful as we think about, you know, homosexuality moving into transgenderism. It’s really interesting to me to think about sexuality from a couple of perspectives that from a moral disposition, you know, we reject as a culture the idea of monogamous sexual relationship between a man and a woman, and that’s a rejection of moral authority. You know, someone like God saying that this is the right way to live life in your sexuality. And then we move into, you know, wanting to approve homosexuality. And we say something like this. Well, I was born this way. It becomes a, you know, I’m going to appeal to the authority of my biology. I’m going to disconnect myself from a moral authority. I’m going to denounce moral authority. I’m going to exalt biological authority.\\nThe movement that we’re in now, which is really intriguing to me, is in the transgender movement, we’re rejecting moral authority, but we’re also rejecting biological authority. We’re completely turning naturalism in on itself as a philosophical idea, and we’re saying, I want to become who I want to become from the inside out, and I’m totally discarding anything that should have authority over my body, whether that be morality related to God, or whether that be my body related to naturalism and we’re in a very chaotic philosophical, sort of space right now. So talk for a second about what are we describing when we say sexual identity constructs.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: So, the sexual identity construct in its Western origin would trace back to the late 19th century. It would trace back to Germany, the rise of the sexologist, you’ve got the rise of the modern psychologists, you’ve got key influencers, the most popular level one would be Freud. Now, Freud wasn’t a sexologist, but Freud comes to the United States, starts publishing some of what he espouses and really it accelerates on the popular level through Freud. And then, from Freud and his influence over the APA, the American Psychiatric Association, which then you’ve got the rise of the Gay Liberation movement. And before we know it, the APA completely changes the way that they look at sexual and gender identity issues, no longer labeling them as mental health disorders. And now, embracing really the original claims that came out of 19th century Germany concerning sexual personhood.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now, what’s interesting to me about that and what you’re getting at here is as sexology began to be a field of study, these different expressions of sexuality were seen as deviant, most of the time, even representative in our DSM-I and II in America, 1952 and 1968 and then a massive debate that happened during the ’70s. And its by-product was to remove homosexuality out of the DSM, and what you have to understand is homosexuality was understood up to that point as being a disorder. Now, as a believer, I would say that’s not a healthy way to categorize. Yes, we believe homosexuality is sin. No question about that biblically, but to label it as a disorder, and it’s an issue of mental health, giving credence into that category, the danger of something like that is now we offer a different means to correct a disorder. And that’s where you get conversion therapy and reparative therapy and those sorts of things. And I think that became a huge misstep for the church really in the twentieth century. It’s a healthy thing that homosexuality was taken out of the DSM; the problem was now it’s categorized as something that is mentally healthy, it’s categorized not as something that is sexually deviant from a moral perspective or a social perspective, it is seen as something that is healthy. It’s a healthy way to pursue life that has moral implications, and that’s what’s overrun the church. And this is where, you know, we get to things like the APA becoming involved. And now saying, that really us, as Christians are the ones who are somewhat mentally unhealthy, who are saying that, you know, living this lifestyle is a sin before a holy God, and that we’re the ones who are propagating the lack of mental health or keeping mental health from an individual is really how the story goes. What do you think changed with the Gay Liberation Movement and Obergefell?\\nSeth Leeman: There was change there. I wouldn’t locate the huge amount of change necessarily there. I would trace it a little bit further back; you’ve got these perversions, seen as perversions labeled as sin. That’s going back to the early 18th century, the late 17th century. And then the shift as we move away from biblical authority, the rise of humanism, the rise of rationalism, as we begin to depend less upon God and more upon what we can do scientifically. That’s where to me, a critical shift happens, there’s a critical shift, where we think that these problems need to be looked at freshly and they can be handled without God, and so there’s still enough working within our conscience that there’s almost this idea that well, it’s not right, it’s not right, but we’re not gonna call it sin. So we’re going to come up with, there’s got to be a reason that these people behave in these perverse ways, and it’s got to be either biological or it’s got to be mental, but the further we move down that road and to get to your question where we get in very, very recent days, the more there’s a growing acceptance of the concept of these natural variants like “homosexuality is just a certain portion, a certain percentage of the population is going to be homosexual. It’s just a variety that just happens, a product of evolution” the more that we accept that and we lose the moral authority then if I am just a different person if this is personhood then it becomes political like why would you get between me and my, you know, fullness, the satisfaction of my life, a good life. Why would you, if we’re going to cede that there is no moral authority, then why should anyone stand against me? And I think it’s kind of a cross-thought, but there were legitimate reasons to be somewhat critical of this reclassification. So, you’ve got legitimate criticisms, overreaches of modern psychology that’s undermining their authority all throughout this time; they’ve been wrong on a lot of other things. And so it’s just natural for people to conclude, well, you’re also wrong on this. And then once they pivot, and they no longer classify it as a mental disorder, well then, Katy bar the door. There’s no way. You can’t stop Obergefell.\\nDale Johnson: It becomes the fruit of what of the ideas that have been happening, right?\\nSeth Leeman: Right.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah. So, if we, even if we were to take this idea that’s fruited as you mention in a decision like the Obergefell decision and the Gay Liberation movement that we see as you describe historically there were markers of this kind of stuff unfolding with sexologist issue. As you said, Freudian Theory rooting this in personhood and really borrowing our self away from a puritanical Victorian-era idea. And then in the 1960s, you have a professor like Alfred Kinsey who supported by all sorts of educational foundations to do his research on, you know, really licentious and very immoral sexual perspectives, which led to sexual revolution in the 1960s. And then you see the advent of, you know, the sex industry in America and that sort of thing. And it really begins to unleash, as you just described, Katy bar the door; it unleashes what we see on a massive scale sexual immorality. And it’s interesting that the church is sort of just watching all of this unfold, and because of its connection to sexual identity construct, its connection to personhood, it seems as though we’ve taken a back seat to some degree because we have bought into to some, at least, to some degree. We’ve bought into the idea that this is associated with a person’s mental health and their ability to be healthy on some mental level, and the church has said that’s not our domain. That’s not our world. And we’ve allowed the mental health world to sort of address this.\\nI find it interesting because what we see now unfolding is all of the laws in the ordinances that are attempting to be passed in a lot of different places around the country, barring conversion therapy, that sort of thing, which will affect the church and us as biblical counselors on some level. I mean, what recently was published in in 2022, the case against conversion therapy written by the APA, a collection of authors by the APA. And that the primary target is conservative Christians in that particular book, saying that it is conservative Christians that are maintaining high levels of stress for those who are struggling with this sexual identity construct, and it’s our moral disposition that that’s continuing to contribute to their mental health struggles. And to me, that’s, that’s quite a shame because, you know, once the day described their perspective as being a position or disposition of mental health, the only other alternative is to describe what we think is biblical fidelity. And what is most helpful and hopeful for a person struggling with sin in their heart and their desires and passions that are at war within them. Now, we become a picture of what’s mentally unhealthy, and the place that that could lead is tremendously alarming, I would think.\\nSo, Seth what I want to do now is, we have a little bit of the background. We talked about some of these ideas, and man, our minds, I’m sure, are going in a thousand directions of all that we could be speaking of and all that we would love our listeners to know about relative to this topic, but talk for just a second about, why we on a podcast that is for biblical counselors why we think this is an important issue for biblical counselors. I mean, we believe in the Bible’s authority relative to human sexuality. We believe in monogamous, heterosexual relationships, one man, one woman for life. We believe in that. Why do we need to even be talking about something like this? Why is this important?\\nSeth Leeman: You could answer this from a variety of perspectives. On one hand, I could say it’s really important because we’re commanded to love God with all our heart, soul, our strength, and our mind. So, the way that we think matters. I could also answer it from more of a Proverbs perspective. Proverbs remind us that as a man thinks in his heart, so is he. So I think it’s really important as we engage with a population that is increasingly identifying as LGBTQ+. I think in a recent pew survey, it was like back in 2000, around 2012 or so, 3.5% of the population identified as LGBTQ, 2021 that jumps to 7.5%. But if you look amongst Generation Z, Generation Z identifies over 20% as\\xa0LGBTQ+.\\nSo, in all of our churches, where we are ministering with real people, we’re going to be increasingly sitting down with people who are at a crossroads, and the crossroads is they’re coming to us with this type of framework in their mind. They see themselves as a sexual person, primarily as a sexual person. I mean, they are gay, they are lesbian, they are trans, they are you fill in the blank. They’re coming to us with that mindset. It’s not just they’re coming to us believing that this is wrong, and they’re wanting to know how can I consistently overcome temptation. No, they’re coming with an assumption this is who I am, but I’m being confronted in the church with this idea that I cannot act in these ways. I can’t live this way as a Christian and be received into this covenant community. You would discipline me if I were to behave in these manners, and we’ve got to be able to sit down with that person and help them tear down the unbiblical framework that has been built, how they see themselves in the mirror, what society has said about them. We got to tear all that down, and then we’ve got to help them rebuild carefully, “Here’s what God says about you. Here’s what God says about human personhood. Here’s what God says about sexuality”. Let’s compare the weight that God puts on sexuality with the weight that our culture puts on sexuality. Here’s what you’ll find, our culture is obsessed with sexuality, which Freud was. Right, he said the greatest of all human pleasures is the fulfillment of your libido. Therefore, if you want a happy life, pursue your libido as much as you can, and we got on that train many moons ago. And look where it’s carried us. So we’ve just got to be ready to interact with these people at that level. And the Bible has such a rich answer. Such a rich story to tell us who we are and we just need to be ready to do that.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now, I want to get into that, but before we go there, one of the things I think is really may be critical for us to consider when you described the whole LGBTQ and sort of what’s coming to us from young people and that the stories that they’re hearing and the realities they’re hearing it. Two quick thoughts, as you were describing that. First, it’s interesting to me that how the Bible predicts that as the days grow colder that we will call good evil and evil good. We’re seeing that unfold before our eyes in a way that we may be in my lifetime never thought quite possible to the degree that we’re seeing the deception that we’re experiencing right now.\\nThe second bit of that as you were describing LGBTQ+. It’s interesting to me that these philosophies that we’re describing right now, Seth, shouldn’t be intriguing to any of us as those who love the Bible. The whole LGBTQ construct is sort of imploding on itself to some degree where the LGB section of that string of identities, if you will, is really upset with the whole transgender narrative because, in a lot of ways, it’s a denial of the reason or the cause, for which a person might think that they’re gay, they’re lesbian, they’re bisexual from a biological perspective or inconsistent with their biology, whereas the trans community is a total reconstruction of that narrative itself. And even in most recent days, you’ve seen some chaos unfold with is this really what the LG and B signed up for when it comes to transgender ideology, especially in the ways in which we’re seeing it affect.\\nSo, back to topic as we think about this, just to finish that thought. It’s really important for us to just see the Bible predicts that when these types of evil ideologies, deceptive thoughts happen, it breeds more and more chaos. I just want you all to pay attention to that chaos it’s being bred right now in the culture in which we live in. I think that’s another identification biblically that the Bible is telling the story that when evil continues to grow, this is how we see it unfold in and much more and more chaos. Let’s get back to topic. Seth, maybe we’ll finish with this. We’ve been going a little long, and we’ll do this for another week to talk about this subject, but I want to describe the difference between Scriptures’ identification of sinners, and the modern sexual identity construct’s identification of sexual persons. I want us to clearly understand those differences as Scripture articulates those.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: So, Scripture will put a label on sin. So Scripture speaks of liars, adulterers, blasphemers. Scripture puts a label on sin. Scriptures labels describe the human person in accordance with their sin or rebellion. So there’s nothing necessarily wrong with referring to a person as a sodomite. If you called a person a sodomite, what you’re saying is that’s a person, a human person made in the image of God, a man or a woman, young or old. That’s a person, but I’m describing them by their sin, just like we might see our children playing and one of our children says to the other child, you’re a liar. That’s fair. We see that type of language in Scripture; we’re labeling a person, a man, or a woman according to their sin. \\nWe’re not making an ontological claim. We’re not saying, hey, my brother there ontologically as a being by definition is a deceiver. We should expect nothing else than deceit from him. If we get between him and his deception, we’re only standing between him and his fulfillment in life. You know, we are marring his ability to live a full and satisfying life. We would never talk like that. Scripture talks about people and scriptural label people in accordance with their sin. The sexual identity construct takes what used to be categories of sin and makes an ontological claim. This is who you are as a person. This is who you are at the core. This affects the way that you think, the way that you eat, the way that you dress, where you go, who you hang out with, and I don’t disagree with all of that. The implications of how you think they’re deep and they’re much more consequential than sometimes we think initially. But that’s making an ontological claim. And it’s a wrong claim. We are sinners. We are sinners by way of Adam’s choice. We are sinners by way of our own choice. We are sinners, yet, to say or elevate who I am ontologically to elevate my sin above the fact that I’m a man or woman created by God in His image to worship Him and enjoy Him forever. When we begin to define ourselves by our sins, it’s just not done in Scripture in that way.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I think that’s helpful, and I hate that we have to close here. I’m going to give you a chance for maybe a final thought or two, but I think this is really critical for us to see the shape of how the Bible describes these things differently. These sexual identity constructs that our modern world has come up with this is why we talk all the time on this podcast and at ACBC that the way in which we categorize problems matters. It matters how we think about these problems because it narrows the field for which we look for remedy and the Bible gives sufficient explanation for how and why a person struggles in particular ways, including with a person’s sexuality and how they understand themselves related to the world that they live in. And this is exactly a part of what you’ve described here. So, as we close this, we’re going to come back for another week. I have to invite you back because we have a lot that we still need to talk about, but maybe final thoughts as we close out today. Give you a shot for that.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: I would implore any person listening, if God gives you the opportunity to work or counsel with someone that’s struggling in this arena of sexual or gender identity, to address the constructs, not just the behaviors, address the constructs, address how does your counselee see themself, whose voice are they listening to? God’s voice or the serpent’s voice? How are they framing their understanding of personhood? That matters. That has huge implications, and at least amongst the youth that I have counseled over the past two years, gone are the days where it’s a given that people are coming to us with inherent or default biblical anthropology. People are coming to us because of various things that have been brought into schools or maybe the failures of the modern evangelical church. People are coming to us, and they are taking these neologisms, these new categories, these new constructs, they’re taking them as gospel, and the biblical construct is very foreign to them. It’s a new language. It’s a new way of seeing things. And it’s transforming potentially, but it’s definitely new.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Yeah, and you have to help them to see that that’s a part of what you’re describing. I think that’s the work of precision that I mentioned at the very beginning of our podcast today is understanding these constructs, how a person thinks when they are saturated when that type of thinking has pervaded their hearts and their minds, and then how do we help them from a Biblical perspective to understand, to expose those deceptions and those lies about what the world is saying regarding their personhood, and that’s a more biblical approach and it’s going to take time to work with that person, gently, kindly, but boldly with the truth of Scripture to speak into their life and to apply those truths to unveil the deception of those constructs in their heart and mind. It’s going to take time to do that. Thanks for your help.\\xa0\\nSeth Leeman: One\\xa0thing I was going to say is this, everyone has a construct, everyone’s got a construct, how you’re putting things together. That’s what construct means. The question is, is your construct biblical? If it’s biblical, then it’s true, and it’s right. And it’s a good foundation. If it’s not biblical, oh, then it’s sand, and your house is going to be destroyed, and so we just want to be more aggressive about building God’s construct and tearing down the false ones.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Yeah, and the whole goal is for that person to benefit, to help them to stand in a very evil day. It’s not; I mean, the language that’s placed on us now is that we’re doing this in a way that is destructive and harmful to a person when from a Biblical perspective, nothing could be more hopeful, nothing could be more helpful, nothing could be more stabilizing to use a language of Scripture, and that’s the importance of the work that we’re doing.\\nSeth, I appreciate your thinking on this. You’re doing a lot of thinking, I’m looking forward to the work that you’re going to do in writing the dissertation just on this particular topic, a little bit of history, and I’m looking forward to see what the Lord brings out of that. So, thanks, brother.\\nSeth Leeman: Sounds good.\\n\\nHelpful Resources:\\nClick here for more information about ACBC’s fall Refuge Retreat for pastors and their wives.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

Many couples struggle in their physical relationship and physical intimacy is an important part of the marital relationship. To counsel marriages, we must be prepared to address it. We must be prepared to talk about it, to ask questions, and to engage respectfully, carefully, and with wisdom—but also with boldness knowing that God’s Word speaks to every aspect of life.\\nYou may ask, “Is this really a problem?” The reality is this is something we need to be prepared to address, just like every other part of a marriage. To not do so would almost be like trying to do marriage counseling, but not talking about communication. Or trying to do marriage counseling, but never talking about finances. Or trying to do marriage counseling, but never talking about parenting. All of it would leave this gaping hole, and I think the same is true when we try to do marriage counseling, but don’t talk about physical intimacy.\\nSexual struggles in marriage come from all sorts of different places. It’s not all just a specific sexual sin or lust. It comes from past sin, from personal selfishness, from idolatry—maybe it’s the idolatry of sexual pleasure, maybe it’s some other idolatry that it causes problems like idolatry in power, control, escape, acceptance, or self-worth. Lust causes problems in physical intimacy. Laziness causes problems in physical intimacy. As biblical counselors, I’m actually going to assume that you’re equipped through your training for how to address all of those different heart issues, how to wrestle through those and walk people through those things.\\nIn our limited time I’m not going to reiterate that which I am assuming you already know how to do so well. If there’s one significant contributor to sexual struggles in marriage that I’ve found in the lives of counselees—and I actually find that many in the church aren’t equipped for—is in one sense so basic that we kind of just hop over it. It’s the answer to the simple question: What did God create sex for?\\nIf it counselee ever asked you the question, “What did God create sex for?” Would you know quickly how to answer them?\\nThe church today has spent a significant amount of time and energy—and rightfully so—discussing what God-glorifying sex is not. But I’m afraid we haven’t spent near enough time talking about what it is.\\nHaving a firm grasp on what God created sex for will help us identify what's askew in their relationship. Click To Tweet\\nKnowing the purpose of sex helps us to identify what’s off when our counselees face sexual struggles. Having a firm grasp on what God created sex for will help us identify what’s askew in their relationship.\\nMany of the couples we counsel say, “Okay, sex is not with someone of your same gender: Check. Sex is not with someone who is not your spouse: Check. Sex is not pornography: Check. Okay, I seem to have gotten all this right, so why is this so hard? Why do we continue to struggle? Why does this continue to be a significant place of tension in our relationship?”\\nOver the years I’ve found that tons of married couples struggle sexually because they have no idea ultimately what God created sex for. Similarly, I think the struggles of the single people in our churches are made significantly harder by the fact that they don’t know what God created sex for. We haven’t taken the time to equip them. The church’s position toward singles has seemingly been to say, “You’re not supposed to do it, so we can’t tell you.” They need to have a theology of sex that helps to make sense of why it’s so beautiful and perfect in the context that God created it for.\\nWe’re not going to talk about singles and how God’s purpose for sex equips them—and that’s a whole different topic (and I think a good one), but we’ll talk here about how it affects married couples. Most married couples you counsel will have struggles in their sexual life.\\nMarried couples tend to actually have a lot of questions about what sex is and the place it should hold in their marriage. A lot of married couples really don’t know how to think of sex. To treat sex as unimportant seems kind of like a bummer, but because the world talks so highly of it, they think maybe as Christians we shouldn’t think it’s that important; but to think of sex as ultimately important doesn’t seem right either.\\nYet, to ask questions about sex is downright embarrassing. That’s why so many don’t. They live without the Word of God ever penetrating into this significantly powerful aspect of their life and aspect of their relationship.\\nThis is why we as counselors need to be the ones who are able to provide that safe place. If they can’t talk to us about this, who in the world can they talk to? If they can’t talk to somebody who’s offering them biblical counsel, who are they asking to get that information? Who is going to bring the Word of God and the glory of God to bear into this area of their life? If they can’t think it up on their own, who else are they going to go to?\\nWe need to know what God says about sex and we need to be comfortable and confident enough to facilitate conversations among couples regarding their sex lives. Do you think I’m comfortable talking to you about this? But I can make it in an infinitely worse by acting awkward—just like you can make it infinitely harder in your counseling relationships.\\nBy talking about it plainly, talking about it confidently and uplifting the Word of God, we can actually do them a great service and show them that marital sex is meant to not have shame—because so many of them carry so much shame with them.\\nWe also need to exercise discretion and wisdom, obviously. Not getting into specifics between the two of them alone, but providing clarity and guidance that can be genuinely helpful. The tendency of most counselees who desire to honor the Lord—and I would say the tendency of most Christians—is to take the Word of God and they want it to transform every area of their life. They want it to transform their home life, their work life, their relationships, their friendships, their family, and everything—except the bedroom. Even the most dedicated Christians oftentimes tend to close the bedroom door and leave God outside. They say, “All my life is for Him, but I don’t know what to do with Him in here. I guess this is just for us, because it’s I can’t imagine Him being a part of this.”\\nToo many Christians do this. If we are not able to discuss these topics with them, then all we do is reinforce that mindset.\\nWhat is Sex?\\nWhat is sex? What did God create it for? Why did He create it so powerful? Why did He create it so enjoyable? Why did He create it so complex?\\nIn the first chapter of Sex in the Supremacy of Christ, John Piper writes:\\xa0“God created us in his image, male and female, with personhood and sexual passions, so that when he comes to us in this world there would be these powerful words and images to describe the promises and pleasures of our covenant relationship with him through Christ.”\\nDo you hear what he’s saying here? Piper is saying that God created sex as a means by which He may communicate to us about our relationship with Him. In fact, He created sex as one of the means to provide a vocabulary for us, so that we might have concepts to understand what our relationship with Him is like.\\nWhy shouldn’t it be? Ultimately sex is about God. Sex is not for the glory of people. God created it—like He created everything else in this world—for His glory. Colossians 1:16 tells us, “For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him.”\\nPractically, sex is about us—it's about a relationship. But ultimately, it's meant to teach us about God. Click To Tweet\\nPractically, sex is about us—it’s about a relationship. But ultimately, it’s meant to teach us about God.\\nWe see in Scripture that God’s glory is demonstrated in sex through four fundamental purposes. The four fundamental purposes of sex:\\n1. Sex is a means of covenantal union.\\n2. Sex is a means of mutual pleasure.\\n3. Sex is an expression of the marital relationship.\\n4. Sex is an expression of the relationship between Christ and the Church.\\nThe reason I would call these the fundamental purposes of sex is because they lay the foundation for our understanding of God’s design for sex and for a sex life that glorifies God. These are the fundamental purposes, meaning that if any one of them is missing, our engagement in physical intimacy—even in marriage—ceases to glorify God.\\nThis is to be distinguished from secondary purposes. Secondary purposes are things like procreation and protection against sin. Similarly, these are purposes of sex, however sex can still be God-glorifying even when these aren’t present. Otherwise physical intimacy among otherwise infertile couples could not be God-glorifying. We know that’s not true.\\nI believe God never intended for every sexual encounter in marriage to be procreative. He didn’t create us that way. Even before the fall things weren’t created that way. He didn’t command Adam and Eve once she was pregnant to not come together again until it was possible for her to get pregnant again.\\nProcreation is a secondary purpose. It is absolutely connected, but it’s not one of the things that without it our physical intimacy in marriage cannot be God-glorifying.\\nSex is a Means of Covenantal Union\\nGenesis 2:24 says, “Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.”\\nObviously, while Adam and Eve’s becoming of one flesh certainly entails more than just their sexuality, it doesn’t entail less. Through the physical act of becoming one flesh, the husband and the wife are brought together in a union that includes and affects their whole person. This is a physical engagement that unifies them—body and soul.\\nThis is the basis for Paul’s warning in 1 Corinthians 6 about sexual activity outside of marriage. In\\xa01 Corinthians 6:14-16, he says, “The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power. Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, “The two will become one flesh.”\\nPaul is saying that even in sexual intimacy as casual as sex with a prostitute—something happens. That’s not just a physical act, you’re becoming one flesh with her. That physical act is a means of union.\\nThis union, this bonding, is written on the makeup of our bodies. It’s written on us hormonally in how we were created. In sexual intimacy, this bonding is represented hormonally by the release of oxytocin in women and vasopressin in men. Really briefly, for an example, oxytocin causes the sensation in a woman of relational bonding. It’s an emotional experience of relational bonding, and it’s released in women in four different ways—during labor, during breastfeeding, during intimate touch, and during sexual intercourse.\\nHe tells us in His Word that physical intimacy in marriage is a means union, which is why it belongs in a covenantal structure. Click To Tweet\\nThis is the fingerprints of God’s creation. He tells us in His Word that physical intimacy in marriage is a means union, which is why it belongs in a covenantal structure.\\nSex is a Means of Mutual Pleasure\\nIt doesn’t help us to pretend in the church that sex is not pleasurable. That doesn’t help you in counseling, because God created it to be pleasurable. He created pleasure to bless and glorify Himself.\\nHe created all sorts of pleasure to draw our minds to Him—to the goodness and greatness and glory of Him as the creator. Pleasure serves as a powerful communicator of many of the other purposes of sex. Proverbs 5:18-19 says, “Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.”\\nHe’s talking about being intoxicated with sexual pleasure. Our Christian priorities and our Christian worldview do not hold us back from sexual pleasures. In fact, they heighten sexual pleasure because that pleasure was meant to take place in a covenantal context. When it is experienced in a covenantal context it is unlike casual sex that’s so common, and so tempting for so many.\\nStudies have shown repeatedly that Bible-believing Christian married couples have more sex and enjoy sex more than their non-Christian counterparts. But most of our counselees don’t believe that because they’ve seen the commercials. They’ve watched the shows, they watch Netflix and they come away with the idea that married sex is boring.\\nSex is an Expression of the Marital Relationship\\nThe definition of an expression is a lively or vivid representation of meaning, sentiment, or feeling. Our sexuality gives voice to many different aspects of our marital relationships. In a similar way, music provides an expression for emotions. You can tell somebody, “I love you. You’re very important to me. I value you more than any other person.” That’s a beautiful thing, but it communicates differently when you say that same sentiment poetically, and it communicates something different when you put that poetry to verse. You put that poetry to verse, and you sing a romantic song, it expresses that same truth in a uniquely powerful way.\\nGod created us as beautifully creative beings. All different art forms express meaning in uniquely powerful ways. Physical intimacy in marriage expresses so many of the dynamics of marriage in uniquely powerful ways. Not in the ultimate way—it’s not the greatest way, but in uniquely powerful ways.\\nWe read in Genesis 2:25 that, “And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.” We can read that and think, “Whoa.” When you read that they were naked and not ashamed, why does that feel weird? It’s because of your sexuality. Sexuality has this powerfully expressive aspect to it.\\nSong of Songs paint such an incredible picture of mutuality, intimacy, passion, and ecstasy in the marital relationship. Have you ever you wondered why God created physical intimacy to produce such an immediate and momentarily ecstatic feeling? Is it just because He wanted to give you a good wedding present?\\nI think most Christians get married and believe and are taught that sex is God’s wedding present to them. That’s about all the theology they get about it. It’s like the perk. Similar to presents on Christmas—it’s been wrapped up, it’s been sitting under the tree for years, and now you can open it. So often that’s all they know.\\nThat kind of euphoria isn’t created because of a perk, it’s not created because God had to have it to make people reproduce and otherwise, they wouldn’t do it. It’s because He wanted to express the joy and ecstasy of what He intended through marriage in a powerful and tangible way. This is a uniquely powerful relationship and it gets expressed in uniquely powerful ways.\\nSex is an expression of the marital relationship. This is where every counselee all of a sudden gets awkward, because sex is an expression of the marital relationship, and the marital relationship in expression of the relationship between Christ and His church.\\nGod created marriage to teach us about the relationship between Christ and His church.\\nSex is an Expression of the Relationship Between Christ and the Church\\nEphesians 5:31 says, “‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.”\\nThe marital relationship, and sexuality specifically, was designed by God as a way to communicate His love, passion, intimacy, and joy with a human race that was created in His image. Click To Tweet\\nThe marital relationship, and sexuality specifically, was designed by God as a way to communicate His love, passion, intimacy, and joy with a human race that was created in His image.\\nThe vulnerability of shameless nudity is the way God communicates to us what safety and vulnerability we can have with Him. The intimacy experienced in our sexual relationships communicate in a powerful way what it’s meant to be united with Christ. The ecstasy experienced communicates a glimpse of what it will be like to be His church and spend eternity in the presence of our Savior.\\nSex is not about Christ and His church in its actions, that’s heresy. That’s where we need to be careful. Sex is about Christ and His church in its expressions and its effects. As married couples reflect on that aspect of our relationship, God designed it to point us to Him, remind us of His glory, teach us about just what He’s capable of, give us a taste so that we might just glory in what perfect intimacy will be like, what perfect vulnerability will be like, what perfect joy will be like.\\nThis is an expression of Christ and the church, that’s why couples need to be so careful because in the context of sexuality you are always vividly expressing something.\\nSex is always vividly expressing. It’s either vividly expressing your selfishness, your self-centeredness, and your idolatry—it’s putting it on in bold display—or it’s putting God-centeredness and the glory of God on bold display. You don’t get the option of sex not putting anything on display. Just like every area in your life, and in a uniquely powerful way, sexuality is always boldly displaying, vividly representing, and expressing something.\\nIf the Word of God is truly sufficient, it’s sufficient for all of marriage, and it’s sufficient for every part of marriage. Everything must flow from an accurate understanding of what God created physical intimacy for.\\nSex is a means of union: Does it unite us?\\nSex is a means of pleasure: Is it pleasurable?\\nSex is an expression of the marital relationship: Does it express mutual love between us?\\nThat’s our biblical foundation, and now I want to spend time thinking through how that looks put into practice. What does it look like to talk with couples about how to grow in these areas?\\nHow do we help couples to practically pursue physical intimacy that unites, is pleasurable, and expresses mutual love?\\n10 Steps to a Beautiful, God-Glorifying Sex Life\\nThese aren’t meant to be taken in order. The goal here isn’t to have your counselees complete number one, then move onto number two, etc. They’re meant to be practical applications of the principles we’ve discussed. If these four fundamental purposes are what God created physical intimacy for in marriage, then what are the areas that we can apply? What are ways that we can do that?\\nI intended each one of these to be an area for you to develop homework in. This is kind of a push start on homework assignments, to give you ideas for how you can develop projects for growth to assign to the people you’re counseling to help them strengthen, grow, think through, and wrestle through how they are pleasing God in this area of life.\\n1. Apply the Gospel to Your Sexual Past, Present, and Future\\nWhen we see what God created sex for, your counselees are going to be reminded of the ways that they fall short.\\nThey will see the ways that God’s design for sex hasn’t been their experience of physical intimacy—maybe that’s not even presently their experience of physical intimacy. They will be reminded of all the ways we’re not back in Eden yet. We need to remind people of what God created sex for, but also regularly and constantly apply the gospel to the ways that they’ve suffered the sexually in their past, their present, or may even in their future, and the ways that they have sinned.\\nWe need to be reminding them basic truths like Romans 8:28. There’s no way they have suffered that is beyond God’s redemption.\\nThere’s no abuse they’ve experienced, no coercion they’ve experienced, no ways that they’ve suffered sexually that are beyond God’s beautiful and glorious redemption, or that disqualify them in any way from pursuing what God created covenantal physical intimacy to be.\\nRomans 8:28-29 says, “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.”\\nGod wants to take every area in our life, and redeem our suffering by making us more and more into the image of His Son—including this area. Click To Tweet\\nGod wants to take every area in our life, and redeem our suffering by making us more and more into the image of His Son—including this area.\\nFor those counselees who have sinned sexually—which means all of them—who have pursued self-pleasure and idolatry over the glory of God in their sex lives, there is a hope as well. God is redeeming, He is sanctifying, He’s making them more and more into the image of His Son.\\nNo matter what they have done, no matter what idolatry exists in their past, there may be consequences, but there is no condemnation. As Romans 8:1-2 says, “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.”\\nTo grow in this area of their life (as in any area of their life) they need to be saturating themselves in the gospel, applying the truth of the gospel to every aspect of their past, present, and future. Again, who else are they going to talk to about this? And who else if they talk about how they’re struggling in their marriage in this area is going to bring the freedom of the gospel to bear?\\nWe need to help them resist the lies and the claim that the gospel is not powerful enough for what they’ve been through, who they are, or what they’ve done. The gospel and God’s grace is always bigger.\\n2.\\xa0 Set your affection on your spouse\\nIf this is what God created physical intimacy to be, we need to encourage and call them to set their affections on their spouse. This is modeled in Song of Songs.\\nI don’t think this was written by Solomon, it was honored and given to Solomon. But when we look at the rest of Solomon’s life, there’s a bit of a discontinuity there. Regardless, the shepherd in Song of Songs and his wife model for us how to set your affection on your spouse.\\nThe shepherd and his wife in Song of Songs were not objectively the most beautiful people in the world. The intent of that book is not for us to say, “Wow, he got the most glorious woman. She’s to be praised among 10,000. I guess he’s got number one. But who am I gonna end up with?”\\nThat’s not what he’s communicating. Song of Songs is not the story of the two most attractive people, where the reason they speak about each other—and even speak about each other physically—is because of some objective, literal observation. Rather, in their love, they have set their affection on their spouse. Their spouse has become to them the very definition of beauty.\\nGod’s created this person for them, and so instead of looking elsewhere and thinking, “Well that part of that woman, or that part of that man, is better,” instead they recognize that this person—this embodied soul—that they’re covenanting to is now the place of their affection.\\nThat’s why in Song of Solomon 4, he can say, “Behold, you are beautiful, my love, behold, you are beautiful! Your eyes are doves behind your veil. Your hair is like a flock of goats leaping down the slopes of Gilead. You are altogether beautiful, my love; there is no flaw in you.”\\nIt that a literal statement? Where he’s saying, “Amazing. I got the one flawless woman!” No, he says that because if it was in her—if it was a part of her, the embodied soul, whom he loved—it wasn’t a flaw. It was beautiful because he had set his affection on her.\\nShe says of him, “My beloved is radiant and ruddy, distinguished among ten thousand.” The same principle is true, she had set her affection on him.\\nSimilarly, Solomon later did not write that he wished everyone could have a wife like his, because she was so objectively superior. No, he said, “Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.” (Emphases added).\\nBeauty is literally in the eye of the beholder.\\nBeauty is absolutely culturally defined—different cultures define all sorts of different things as beautiful because beauty is subjective in that way. It’s malleable and it’s malleable in our own hearts and minds. If sex is a means of union, if it’s a meant to express the fullness of your love for another person, then it starts with internally setting your affection on that person. Not on all those things out here, but setting your affection on that person.\\nThis is so incredibly difficult in our pornographic world. Porn is everywhere. The guy you’re meeting with next week is probably looking at porn, and that undercuts everything that God is doing. There’s grace for that, God can redeem from it—He absolutely can and He does bring freedom.\\nIf your counselees are going to pursue God’s design for physical intimacy, we have to call them not just to look away from pornography, but look to their spouse and set their affection on their spouse.\\n3. Learn your spouse’s desires\\nEvery married person has different desires and a different amount of desire than their spouse. I have counseled couples where the husband desires sex more than his wife. I’ve counseled couples where the wife desires sex more than her husband. The only couple I have never counseled is the couple that wants it the same.\\nThat’s not a flaw. That’s not incompatibility. God created it this way. If your desires in marriage were the same, you would have no opportunity to express love. The expression of selfishness, would be the exact same thing as the expression of love.\\n“Why are we together? Because I want it—and whenever I want it you want it, it’s magic.” There’s no sacrifice there. There’s no others-centeredness. I could be completely selfish and it wouldn’t matter. That’s not how it is. That’s not how it’s meant to be.\\nSimilarly if your counselees are to grow together in their relationship, they need to both study the Word of God and His truth and they need to be students of each other. Click To Tweet\\nWe need to encourage couples to be students of each other, to learn. This is a similar to counseling. In counseling you have to study the Word of God and you have to study the person, so that you might apply the Word of God accurately and in wisdom to the person. Similarly if your counselees are\\xa0to grow together in their relationship, they need to both study the Word of God and His truth and they need to be students of each other. Learn each other, learn their physical desires, learn their timing desires, learn their personality desires.\\nEd Wheat puts it this way, “If you do what comes naturally in lovemaking, almost every time you will be wrong.”\\nPhilippians 2 tells us, “Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.” This starts with learning the desires of others.\\n4. Consider your spouse’s desires\\nLearn your spouse’s desires, then the next step is to consider your spouse’s desires.\\nFirst learn what they are, and then next actually take them into consideration.The book knowledge isn’t enough, we must actually take them into consideration. 1 Corinthians 7:4 tells us, “For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.”\\nWe’re meant to take one another’s desires into consideration and to put others before ourselves.\\nThat’s not domineering either way. It’s not forcible either way. But it is meant for you to learn one another’s desires, to be students of one another’s desires, and then to consider one another’s desires and to put those into practice.\\nEvery couple always asks, “Okay, but what do we do when we have different desires?” That’s the big question.\\nWhat do you do when you have different desires about what restaurant you’re going to go to? I mean, I’m assuming you have different desires constantly in all sorts of areas in life. What do you do when you have different desires? You talk openly, you talk honestly, and you seek to serve and sacrifice for one another as you grow in Christlikeness.\\nMaybe the words of 1 Corinthians 13 applied specifically to physical intimacy can help. Help the counselee apply in lovemaking that, “Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.”\\nFor homework, simply have them seek to apply love in their lovemaking. What does it look like to consider one another’s desires and to be students one another, and then to manifest Christlikeness in physical intimacy?\\n5. Learn your spouse’s anatomy\\nThis is potentially the most awkward, but I think it’s really important. You need to encourage your counselees to learn their spouse’s anatomy.\\nSome of you are thinking, “Why are we talking about this?” We’re talking about this because they don’t know.\\nMen and women were created to enjoy physical intimacy differently. Yet, 90 percent of couples that get married—even Christian couples—seem to not know that simple fact.\\nDo they know what the typical differences are? If they don’t, who do they get their information from? Help identify where a couple got their education in this area. Most of them are probably going to be from false pornographic or pseudo-pornographic sources. Who are we banking on talking to them—their parents?\\nAre we banking on their pastor making sure that before they say “I do,” they’re talking about this?\\nIn some ways I hope so, but most of the time they’re getting their information from media or movies. Almost always in that setting what is depicted is male-centric sex, depictions about what men generally enjoy. This creates a huge gap in their information. You need to help them provide them with some resources and know where you can point them.\\nThere’s a few books that I think can be helpful resources. I wouldn’t fully affirm everything in these books, but they can be really helpful resources. One is Intended for Pleasure by Ed Wheat. Another is Sheet Music by Kevin Leman. Another is The Act of Marriage by Tim LaHaye.\\nHave you read resources that you can point them to? You need to give them guidance, because they need it. If they’re not going to get this from us, what are they going to do? They’re going to Google it. Don’t let them Google it!\\n6. Learn the (true) biblical guidelines of sex\\nGod has put a fence around our sexuality, but that fence doesn’t exist to limit our enjoyment. It’s meant to keep us safe from harm and free us to true enjoyment within the fence. It’s like a fence that parents put around their front yard so kids don’t go running out into the street, but can be free to enjoy the yard within the fence.\\nThere are things that Scripture and its principles explicitly forbids and they need to know that. Sex is a means of union and expression of the marital union between two people, so it’s forbidden to engage in any sexual acts with any more or any less than those two people.\\nSexual immorality equals sexual activity outside of God’s expressed design for one man and one woman in the context of a covenantal marriage. There are also all sorts of sexual activities that while not explicitly forbidden in Scripture, people have to very careful and probably should wisely avoid.\\nI think of an example like role playing. People may say, “Well, I looked at my Scripture. God never said don’t role play.” Yet, I have a hard time imagining how pretending to be someone else is unifying and is a way that you can express your love for one another.\\nBut there’s also some couples, and probably many couples in our churches, that have taken the fence God made and then have built fence upon fence and now they’re trying to operate in this 3-by-3 yard.\\nWe have to consider that there are some sexual activities that are biblically permissible, maybe even advisable, that people incorrectly view as wrong, vulgar, or dirty. We should never encourage someone to act against their conscience. We start there, we would never encourage anybody to act against their conscience. But like we do in all areas of life, we should also be sources that help to inform their conscience, and bring their conscience in increasing ways in line with Scripture.\\nAs counselors, we need to be biblically informed, studying, considering, “What does the Word of God say?” so that we’re not simply placing our preferences on those we counsel.\\nUse the purposes we’ve discussed before: Does this unify? Is it mutually pleasurable for both of us? Does it express the nature of marriage? Those would be really helpful questions to start with.\\n7. Recognize the importance of frequency\\nRecognize the importance of frequency—that is exactly how I word it with my counselees. I don’t have any specific frequency in mind. I’m not encouraging a certain type of frequency, but if God created physical intimacy to be a means of union, created it to be a way to express in uniquely powerful ways our marital relationship, then unless there are\\xa0extenuating circumstances it should be a regular part of your marital relationship.\\nThe ESV translates 1 Corinthians 7:3 this way, “The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.”\\xa0Now, I love the ESV. I preach from the ESV. I meditate on the ESV. I memorize the ESV. But I’m not sure “conjugal rights” is the best translation there.\\nThe NASB says, “The husband must fulfill his duty to his wife, and likewise also the wife to her husband.”\\nThe NTL says, “The husband should fulfill his wife’s sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband’s needs.” That’s a little closer, but thinking of sex as in need is also very problematic.\\nThe gist of what this passage is communicating, I think is actually helpfully expressed in The Message. I think it actually catches the heart of what God’s after. It says, “The marriage bed must be a place of mutuality—the husband seeking to satisfy his wife, the wife seeking to satisfy her husband. Marriage is not a place to ‘stand up for your rights.’ Marriage is a decision to serve the other, whether in bed or out.”\\nThe importance of frequency simply means that the marriage bed should be a place of mutuality—looking for ways to satisfy and to bless one another. Click To Tweet\\nThat’s a paraphrase, it’s not a translation. But I think it’s a beautiful depiction of what I believe Paul intended here and what God is calling us to. The importance of frequency simply means that the marriage bed should be a place of mutuality—looking for ways to satisfy and to bless one another.\\n8. Appreciate the importance of foreplay\\nI tell couples that if sex is about union, then it’s not just about a physical act. It’s about the whole person, so exploration, flirting, suggesting, cuddling, and teasing are all activities that enhance the sexual experience and unite us, pleasure us, and express our love. Foreplay can be doing dishes, or putting the kids to bed, or coming home early, or just thinking about each other.\\nEncourage them to get away from the idea that sex is just a physical act. It’s a whole person expression of love. C.J. Mahaney, speaking specifically to husbands, in his great book Sex, Romance, and the Glory of God, writes “You have to touch your wife’s heart before you can touch her body.”\\n9. Identify sex’s greatest enemies…and address them\\nFor homework, have your counselees identify, what are the hurdles for them? If you’re too busy to have sex, you’re too busy. Is it tiredness? If you’re too tired to have sex, you’re too tired. Is it individualized entertainment? Put down the individual screens. You know what can help bring people together? Just tell them to share a screen—you don’t even have to turn the screen off, just share one.\\nWhat else gets in the way? Bad hygiene. That may seem obvious, but sometimes counselees need to be told. Hopelessness so often gets in the way. This is why you need to be engaged as a biblical counselor to give hope.\\n10. Pray\\nJohn 15—what an incredible promise—says, “If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Abide in my love.”\\nGod is not after selfish sexual pleasure, He is after Christlike service and love. He will create that—so pray. Click To Tweet\\nIf God’s purpose for this area in our life abides in us, and we abide in Him, then we can ask Him to bring about His design for this area in our lives and we can trust that He wants to bring about the Christlikeness that we’re pursuing. God is not after selfish sexual pleasure, He is after Christlike service and love. He will create that—so pray.\\nIt is God’s specific desire in physical intimacy that it would be a means of union, that it would be a means of pleasure, that it would be an expression of covenantal love, and it would be an expression of the love between Christ and the church. Pray for that as a counselor and tell them to pray for that. I ask them to make prayer a part of their preparation for sex. Stop leaving God outside the door. Come in with Him and say, “God, you’re in here with us. There’s nothing to be ashamed of here. Help us. Help me in this space, where you’re not outside and this is just us, but you’re in here with us.”\\nI ask them to pray for unity as they engage together. Pray that they would be for one another’s pleasure. Pray for the powerful expression of their love. And ultimately pray for not their selfish desires, but pray for God’s glory—because everything in life is about God and His glory, even sex.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScott Mehl is a pastor at Cornerstone West Los Angeles where he oversees leadership development, global ministries, and counseling/discipleship.\", 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Sexual Struggles in Marriage', 'subtitle': ' ', 'author': 'Scott Mehl', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexuality 14', 'question': 'Every married couple experiences seasons of difficulty in their sex life and there is hope in the gospel.', 'body': 'It seems like everyone wants to talk about sex. That is, except for the people who need to talk about it the most. Every married couple goes through seasons of difficulty in their sex life, but they rarely want to talk about it. In our culture that promotes an easy, enjoyable, uncomplicated caricature of sex, struggling sexually can be embarrassing at best and seemingly shameful at worst. Every time I sit with a couple who are experiencing some type of sexual struggles they almost always begin by saying the same thing: “You’re the first person we’ve ever talked to about this.” In fact, they’re oftentimes so embarrassed that they’ve barely talked about it with one another.\\nSexual struggles in marriage take different forms. Whether it’s a lack of sexual arousal, being uncomfortable with a spouse’s desires, reoccurring fantasies, differing degrees of sexual desire, or anything else, sexual struggles can be a significant issue in a marriage.\\nWhen you think of our hyper-sexualized culture combined with our sexually fallen flesh, it shouldn’t be surprising that Christians and non-Christians alike have struggles in their sexual relationships, even when married. But like every consequence of our fallen hearts in this fallen world, there is hope for forgiveness, healing, redemption, and restoration through the gospel. So where do you begin in addressing sexual issues with a couple?\\nUnderstand what Sex Is\\nFirst, the couple needs to understand why God created sex. Most couples get married with either a weak or non-existent theology of sex. They assume that sex is the “perk” that they get along with marriage, like a cosmic wedding gift. But God did not create something as powerful as our sexuality to be just an “add on” to the marriage relationship.\\nGod created sex to be a fundamental part of experiencing marriage. There are three God-given purposes for sex—that is, three purposes without which our sexual relationships fail to glorify God the way he designed them to.\\nSex is a Means of Covenantal Union\\nOur sexuality (which involves all the aspects of attraction, desire, and physical activity) was designed by God as a way by which a husband and a wife can be unified. Through sex God unifies a couple in a beautiful and mysterious way that engages, in one act, the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of our humanity (Genesis 2:24, 1 Corinthians 6:14-20).\\nSex is an Expression of Marital Relationship\\nSong of Songs demonstrates this truth, illustrating how the sexual relationship provides a vivid expression of the intimacy, vulnerability, mutuality, passion, and ecstasy of marriage in a uniquely powerful way. Sex is not the ultimate expression of the marital relationship, but it is a uniquely powerful one.\\nSex is an Illustration of Relational Dynamics Between Christ and the Church\\nIf sex is an expression of the marital relationship, and the marital relationship is meant to be a picture of Christ and the Church, then we cannot deny the direct connection between the two. As John Piper wrote,\\n“God created us in his image, male and female, with personhood and sexual passions, so that when he comes to us in this world there would be these powerful words and images to describe the promises and pleasures of our covenant relationship with him through Christ.”\\nRemember the Power of the Gospel\\nInevitably our sexual experiences fall short of this lofty ideal. Too often sex becomes a source of conflict and disunity. Too often sex becomes an expression of our own self-serving desires instead of our self-sacrificial love. Too often sex illustrates a broken relationship that obscures the words and images God intends us to embody.\\nWhen we are confronted with the fallenness of our sexuality and its consequences in our sexual lives, it can become quickly obvious what we are called to “put off.” But it’s the corresponding call to “put on” selfless sexuality that can seem impossible. Our sexual desires (or lack thereof) are so intimate, so strong, and so seemingly innate that we usually doubt if there is really any hope.\\nI can think back to countless nights in my own marriage that ended in tears when hopelessness gripped our hearts and we truly believed there was no possibility of change. We were so alone, broken, and discouraged that we couldn’t even imagine a way out. It didn’t matter how many books on the topic we read, they all seemed to add to the condemnation that there was something beautiful about sex, but we weren’t able to access it.\\nWe needed more than tips, or tricks, or tools, or time. We needed to be reminded of the truth of the gospel and of the transforming power of the Spirit that is able to transform every part of us, including our sexuality. Our minds needed to be renewed (Romans 12:2, Ephesians 4:23) with the truth of who we are in Christ, who he is continually making us into, and what kind of God he is. We needed to be refreshed with appreciation for his love and kindness and intimacy before we could ever seek to express love and kindness and intimacy toward one another sexually.\\nNow, don’t get me wrong. Being reminded of the gospel is not some one-shot cure to your sexual struggles. Our minds will need to be renewed with the truth of who God is and who he has made us to be for as long as our sexuality is still impacted by the Fall, which will be for the entirety of our lives. But being reminded of the power of the gospel is the foundation to growing in our sexual lives. And it’s the only thing that, in the midst of our deep and pervasive struggles, gives us real and lasting hope.\\nPursue Sex as God Designed It\\nIt is only when we have been reminded of the power of the gospel to transform that we can grow in our sexual struggles. As the Spirit empowers us, we begin to experience sex that looks more and more like what God designed it to be: a means of union, an expression of our relationship, and a picture of Christ and the church.\\nTo that end, we can seek to answer the call to love our spouse sexually in ways that bless him or her and express our deep and abiding love. This means taking time to learn your spouse’s desires and to allow your spouse the time and space to explore your desires as well. No one is saying this won’t be awkward at times, but the gospel empowers us to love others in ways that come naturally and in ways that stretch us.\\nAs our sex lives take on an increasingly eternal perspective we realize that frequency of sex in marriage is important not just because “you want it” or “I want it” but because of how God has called us to relate to one another sexually and express our love for one another in this uniquely powerful way.\\nAnd as we manifest the fruit of the Spirit in our love for one another we will begin to manifest patience with one another’s lack of sexual arousal, kindness when we have differing desires, mental self-control in regards to our fantasies, and the sprouting of hope and joy where disappointment and hopelessness had once reigned.\\nI know that if you’re struggling sexually in your marriage right now, you may be coming to the end of this post wanting more. You want to know where to start. You want to get more specific to your situation. You want to ask questions about how the gospel applies and what Spirit-empowered love looks like. But those aren’t the kind of situation-specific questions I can answer in a blog post.\\nWhich is why you so desperately need to walk through your sexual struggles in marriage in the midst of community. God has given us the body of Christ to walk with us through our struggles. He calls those around us to comfort us, give us hope, renew our minds, and help us find the way forward. If you’re not sure how to bring it up, maybe just forward this post to a friend or a pastor and simply say, “This is me…can we talk?”\\nGod has placed you in the body of Christ you’re in to help you navigate these difficult waters. And if you’re struggling sexually in your marriage, you are not alone. The truth is, in one way or another, we all are. We just don’t like talking about it, even though we desperately need to.\\nThis is not the place to get all of your questions answered, but my prayer is that these truths would, if nothing else, give you hope. Hope enough to continue fighting. Hope enough to reach out to someone in your church family for help. Hope enough to be reminded that God’s work in you isn’t done, and that his work in the sexual area of your marriage isn’t done either.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nMarriage\\xa0\\n                                          Sexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScott Mehl is a pastor at Cornerstone West Los Angeles where he oversees leadership development, global ministries, and counseling/discipleship.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'Same-Sex Physical Attraction in Counseling', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 90', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Sexuality 14', 'question': 'Same-sex attraction is sin and should be handled as any other sin should be handled.', 'body': 'Question:\\xa0We have several questions that have come in related to the topic of same-sex attraction. One of the questions that Christians are asking is should I feel nervous about counseling someone of the same gender who has same-sex attraction?\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Let me say this at the very beginning, we have to admit that every single thing about the question you just asked is controversial. There is a very narrow slice of the population that is not going to be offended by a couple of different elements in that question.\\nFirst of all, the question assumes that same-sex attraction is a problem that requires counseling. It is a minority position to argue that it’s a problem that requires counseling. Secondly, it’s very, very controversial that counseling would even help such a thing. This is a very debated issue and the popular view, certainly on the part of LGBT persons is that counseling doesn’t help because it’s an innate characteristic. There are all sorts of evidence that it is not true, but that doesn’t change that the popular opinion: that it is true. Then you’ve got the issue of the question that could sound kind of prudish: “well, what’s the problem with having these kinds of relationships?” or something like that. \\nThe question as its asked is one of the most controversial things that we could talk about on the podcast. And yet, we do believe as biblical Christians agreeing with 2,000 years of church history, agreeing with faithful exegesis of the text of Scripture today that the Bible does teach homosexuality to be a sin. And that homosexuality is one of the realities that is addressed in the work of Jesus Christ to pay for the sins of people and to purchase change for people. And so, we do have to ask the question, and for people who agree with that worldview, there is some nervousness. I have talked with many church people who have received the opportunity to be in a counseling or a discipleship relationship with someone of the same sex who struggles with same-sex attraction and they’re saying “should I be in that relationship?” And they asked the question not because they don’t want to help somebody, not because they are nervous, or not because they struggle themselves, but they ask for the very same reason that they would ask about counseling someone of the opposite sex. They want to stay above reproach. They don’t want to be a stumbling block and so they wonder, should I do this? And my answer to those questions is always, yes, you should be involved in those kinds of relationships.\\nOne of the most important realities that a person who struggles with same-sex attraction needs is to be in relationship with same-sex persons where those relationships are not going to be sexually charged. And so, one of the greatest ways that we can serve people who struggle with same-sex attraction and who want to change, is by being in a relationship with them where we are going to be approaching it from a standpoint where that’s not a temptation for us. That’s not a struggle for us and that is actually very helpful to them.\\xa0\\n\\u200bQuestion:\\xa0So, then what would you say would be the kinds of topics that should be addressed in that counseling?\\nHeath Lambert:\\xa0This is a huge issue. We can’t deal with that on one podcast but let me just say this: so many people and I know this isn’t what you think, but so many people treat homosexuality, if they address it as a problem at all, they address it like it’s a special problem. People who struggle with the problem of homosexuality, there’s something, especially troubling about them, and they need a very special solution so they can reach a special goal. And I think, as Christians, we just need to admit that so many ways, there’s nothing special about homosexuality at all. Homosexuality is one sin. There are many, many sins that human beings can struggle with, and many sexual sins, many non-sexual sins, and Jesus Christ died to pay for the penalty of all those sins and to purchase purity for all of those sins. And the Bible has revelation that is intended to help Christians lay, hold of that grace to change in all of those difficulties.\\nAnd so, homosexuality is not some special category of sin that requires some special solution, that’s not true of other sins. We use the graces that are in the word of God to address homosexuality, which we would use to address any sin. We want to deal with repentance, we want to deal with drawing near to Jesus. We want to deal with trusting Christ that his commands are good and loving. We want to deal with being selfless and sacrificial in your relationships. We want to deal with uprooting lust in the heart. And we want to deal with pursuing purity in all of your relationships. So, there’s going to be all kinds of things that you would talk about. I talked about some of them in a book that I wrote with Denny Burke called Transforming Homosexuality. But the thing I want to emphasize here is, we pay attention to the change process that is revealed in Scripture. The change process that works for every sin in the Scriptures is the same change process that’s going to work for homosexuality.\\xa0\\nQuestion: So what if in the context of that relationship, that person expresses attraction for you? What should you do then?\\xa0\\nHeath Lambert: Well, first of all, we need to be honest, and I would want people to hear me say this very carefully that that can happen. I mean, attraction develops for same-sex attracted persons the same way attraction develops for opposite-sex attracted persons for heterosexual people. And so, it won’t surprise us that in a relationship like a counseling relationship, a discipleship relationship where you’re talking very openly, you’re talking very honestly. There is a lot of very intimate details of your life that are being exposed and you are engaging in a helpful conversation, you’re trying to be sensitive and caring and all the things that a good counselor, a good discipler needs to be, it doesn’t surprise us that attraction would develop in that relationship for somebody who is same-sex attracted.\\nAnd when that happens as it sometimes will, a person who is on the receiving end of that attraction should not feel threatened in any way. In fact, I think that they should just see this as another opportunity to serve this person and to love this person that God has placed in their path. I think that you could make a couple of things, clear.\\nNumber one, that you are glad that they told you this, that relationships are founded upon candor, and you appreciate their honesty in that regard. I think that you should recommit to them your intentionality to honor Christ and your relationship, and to pursue a relationship with them that is completely pure. You’re not threatened by that, you’re not tempted to quit being their friend, you love them as much now as you did before, but you want to love them with all purity like a brother or like a sister in Christ. And then I think you need to help them deal with that. Like, hey you being attracted to me is just one issue in our relationship that we need to deal with, there will be others. Every relationship has things come up in it, that we need to deal with. And so, what we need to do is work on it, the Bible says and Romans chapter 12 that we’re transformed by the renewal of our minds. And so, then I think we just do the work of Christian discipleship. How do we take that thought captive? How do we renew that thought? And how when you begin to experience lust in your heart for me, how can we take that thought captive, uproot the lust, and in order to change in a way where your thoughts are connected to purity and not impurity?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

It is what God has revealed in His Word.', 'body': 'I just read something absolutely fascinating. It was an article about the causes and consequences of sexual expression like homosexuality and transgenderism in The New Atlantis: A Journal of Technology and Society. The article was by Dr. Lawrence S. Mayer, scholar in residence in the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Dr. Paul R. McHugh, former psychiatrist-in-chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital for 25 years. The article was entitled “Sexuality and Gender: Findings from the Biological, Psychological, and Social Sciences.”\\nThis is what the authors said as they reported on their findings about the experience of homosexual and transgender men and women, “Compared to the general population, non-heterosexual and transgender sub-populations have higher rates of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and suicide, as well as behavioral and social problems such as substance abuse and intimate partner violence.” That is a stunner! Homosexual and transgender persons are more anxious, depressed, suicidal, abused, and addicted than everybody else. The information is not stunning because it is new—plenty of other studies have reported the same facts over the years.\\nIt is stunning because we live in a culture that makes an embrace of these aberrant forms of sexuality seem like the only possible option for a society that would be characterized by love and inclusivity. If we are to be on the “right side of history”, if “love wins”, then we must embrace homosexuality and transgenderism. And then comes a scientific research study that indicates that these very behaviors are some of the most dangerous and deadly things a human being can do.\\nChristians have already begun an eager embrace of this newly-released study. They are pointing to it as proof-positive of the dangers of sinful sexuality. They are excited over scientific “proof” that sexual behaviors like homosexuality and transgender are wrong. I suspect such information will turn up in the still un-fought battles over city ordinances in places like Jacksonville where elected officials are, even now, seeking to impose their preferences for faithless sex on the electorate. I want to be clear that I am thankful for much in a research study like this one I referenced. I am glad whenever unbelievers can be honest about the terrible realities of sinful sex. I also want to urge caution.\\nThe “proof” that these behaviors are wrong and harmful is not a scientific research study that points to statistics demonstrating they bring pain. As Christians, we have not been waiting around for a research study to confirm our personal commitments to traditional expressions of sexuality. Christians embrace sex between one man and one woman for life in the context of Christian marriage because God said to the first man and the first woman, “For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife; and they shall be come flesh” (Genesis 2:24), Christians reject that men and women should try to alter their gender because, “God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them” (Genesis 1:27). Christians know that sexual lifestyles that differ from this bring pain because God promised that, “The way of the sinner is hard” (Proverbs 13:15).\\nWe are thankful whenever unbelievers get the truth right. But as Christians, we believe as we do about sexuality, not because we read it in a scientific journal, but because we read it in Scripture, which is our exclusive authority for life and and godliness. The heart of the matter is not our preferences, and it is not science. It is what God has revealed in his Word.\\n\\nThis column originally appeared in the print edition of the Florida Baptist Witness.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSexuality\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

But Jesus’ obedience to God and resistance to Satan’s temptations in the wilderness are instructive for us to resist temptations as Jesus did.', 'body': 'God is never the source of temptation to sin. Instead, the cycle begins with strong desires in our hearts. So perhaps you’re wondering if the devil is involved at all. Yes, he is.\\nJesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by the devil. . . . And when the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from him until an opportune time. (Luke 4:1–2, 13)\\nWe learn much from Satan’s tempting of Jesus. Though Jesus did not have a sin nature as we do, the devil struck at his humanity with full force, and yet Jesus endured. From the devil’s attacks and Jesus’s obedience despite them, we learn five ways Satan is involved in tempting us to sin. We also notice the chief means to resist the devil as our Savior did.\\n1) Satan attacks when you’re most vulnerable.\\xa0The devil’s first temptation appealed to a legitimate physical need for food. Jesus “was hungry” after his forty-day fast (Luke 4:2). Like a shrewd hunter, Satan aimed his arrow at the bull’s-eye of Jesus’s vulnerability. Philip Ryken explains, “What Jesus suffered in the wilderness would have killed a weaker man. His condition was critical. At the end of forty days he was closer to death than at any other point in his life, except the crucifixion.”(1) Be mindful of your weakness and watch out when you are most susceptible to Satan’s attacks.\\n2) Satan casts doubt on God’s Word. The devil planted a big “If” in the mind of the Savior: “If you are the Son of God” was a subtle attack on the integrity of God’s words (4:3). God had just declared Jesus to be his Son at his baptism (see\\xa0Matt. 3:17), but now the devil challenged that word. Satan hasn’t changed. He’s the same sneaky serpent who successfully used an identical tactic on Eve: “Did God actually say?” (Gen. 3:1). As he attempted with both Jesus and Eve, the devil plants the seed of doubt concerning Scripture.\\n3) Satan feeds fleshly pride.\\xa0Jesus successfully resisted Satan’s first attack, so the devil tempted him to break the first commandment by worshipping another god (see\\xa0Ex. 20:3). Satan appealed to humanity’s innate desire for position and power by showing Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and promising, “If you, then, will worship me, it will all be yours” (Luke 4:7). This was an attempt to get the Son of God to grab what rightfully belonged to him before it was time and without having to suffer. But this temptation was a lie! God’s plan to exalt his Son throughout the world required the cross. No cross, no crown. No humiliation, no exaltation (see\\xa0Phil. 2:8–11). When tempted to act in self-will, remember that you are making a choice of who to worship.\\n4) Satan encourages us to test God.\\xa0In the third temptation, the devil tried to manipulate Jesus into foolishly misapplying Scripture by taking a five-hundred-foot “leap of faith.” Satan took him to the pinnacle of the temple and said, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here, for it is written . . .” and then he quoted two Bible verses out of context (Luke 4:9–10; see also v. 11). But the living Word answered the devil by properly quoting from Deuteronomy, where we read of how Israel put God to the test by demanding that Moses produce water for them. If you are tempted to put God to the test, remind yourself of his many promises, as well as his commands to trust him instead.\\n5) Satan never gives up.\\xa0When “the devil had ended every temptation, he departed from [Jesus] until an opportune time.” The devil is relentless. Just as he hounded Jesus all the way to the cross, so he never tires of tempting you. He’s always on the hunt, always waiting for an opportune time. You must “resist him, firm in your faith” (1 Peter 5:9), the same way Jesus did.\\nThree times, the devil tempted Jesus. Three times, Jesus answered, “It is written” (Luke 4:4,\\xa08,\\xa012). We can fight the deceiver’s lies with “the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God” (Eph. 6:17).*\\n\\nThis blog was originally posted at IBCD.

The day that we’ve been longing for, for quite some time around the ACBC offices. Our staff has been well-prepared for this day, October 5th, as we prepare for our Annual Conference. Today, it goes live in a digital format. We’ve never done this before. It’s been an adventure. It’s been quite fun. We’ve enjoyed bringing this process together and we look forward to all of you who are going to join us in our digital format.\\nToday, our Pre-Conference airs live. We are excited about that and the topic that will be at hand: Biblical Counseling and Legal Issues. We’re looking forward to all of you around the country—and even in other parts of the world—who are going to join us for our Annual Conference talking about the issue of Destroying Strongholds: Spiritual Warfare and Biblical Counseling.\\nI just want to say a few brief words to encourage you—to get those of you who are joining us for the conference excited about the content that you’re going to hear. I’m so excited about the men and the women who are going to be leading us through our plenary sessions and our breakout sessions. You are going to hear some wonderful teaching in the fullness of the Word of God. I can’t wait for you to encounter God’s Word on this subject of Destroying Strongholds and Spiritual Warfare.\\nAs I think specifically about my plenary session and the things I desire to communicate, it’s really about the way in which we see life. So often we have a tendency to forget in life that we are in a spiritual battle. We have a tendency to fight the battle in a different battlefront. We engage in war often in a wrong way. One of the things that I really want to communicate through this year’s Annual Conference is to exalt what God has given us in His revelation. And then also to trust that the battlefront that He says is most important is the battlefront we ought to be engaging in.\\nLet me give you an example of what I mean by that. So many times those who are in the secular world, or approach counseling from an integrated perspective, talk about the simplicity of the Word and how much we’ve advanced in relation to how we understand humanity and the different problems humanity has. They talk about the simplicity of prayer, saying prayer is not able to deal with some of the complex issues that we have in the world. I think that’s an unfortunate way to approach what we engage in in this life and the battlefront that we try to engage it in. I want you to think with me very clearly on what the Scripture says here. I want to bring your attention to a couple of passages just in this brief time as we set up our Annual Conference this year.\\nListen to the Word of the Lord in 2\\xa0Corinthians 10:3-4, “For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds.”\\nNow, why in the world do we think Paul had to encourage and remind us to engage in a proper battlefront? Well, because it’s so enticing in the world in which we live to be engaging things that we see with our natural eyes and assume that those things are most important and assume that’s where the battlefront really lies.\\nAnother place Paul writes on this is in Ephesians 6:12, “For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”\\xa0Paul is trying to help us not to be deceived in putting our energy and effort toward the wrong things, to change the things that we think are so important in the here-and-now. He’s trying to help our minds to stay focused on what God tells us to engage in. Who better to define the battlefront than God Himself? For Him to explain why it is that we have trouble, how it is that we have trouble, and how we overcome that difficulty. He says here, “Yes, I acknowledge it: We walk in the flesh. We experience in the flesh in our five senses, but don’t be deceived by those five senses because we don’t wage war according to the flesh.”\\nThis is really all about how we see. So often in the counseling room we talk about data gathering. What’s most important in data gathering is is how we see a person—the framework that we approach a person with. If we’re thinking according to all the problems of a person, according to the terms of the flesh, then we’re going to engage in that battle in a wrong way. We’re going to engage in that battle in a faulty way.\\nAs I mentioned earlier from 2 Corinthians 10:4, “For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power.” If we interpret and listen to the story of a person’s life from the perspective simply of the flesh, it’s not that we dismiss what’s going on in a person’s life, but if we just engage in that person’s life from what we can see in a fleshly sense, we will dismiss divine power, which is able to destroy strongholds within us. That’s where spiritual warfare comes in. Particularly in the counseling room, we have to be very wise in the way we approach this idea spiritual warfare.\\nI couldn’t be more excited about the things that we’re going to discuss at our Annual Conference this year because I think what we’re going to do is help us to understand as counselors—particularly biblical counselors—not to diminish the power of God to engage the things that ail us most, and the beauty of the remedies that He’s offered through Scripture, through the power of the spirit, to engage things that come against us. And then through prayer that we walk faithfully with the Lord and we are comforted by finding our rest and hope directed toward Him. We are called to wrestle—it is a wrestling match. We’re called to engage, and that’s not a duty of passivity. It’s an intentional engagement because the way in which we see the whole picture really matters. It matters in how we walk in life. It matters in how we engage in daily life. All of that, as simple as that seems, as unengaging as that may be, as seemingly at peace as walking around in the world, might seem to us—the reality is that Paul tells us that as we walk we’re to engage in a certain way in legitimate cosmic warfare, which is happening inner man, in our flesh, in the ways in which we stand guard against the schemes of the evil one.\\nThis matters also for we who counsel, because we want to engage in a way that’s appropriate according to Scripture that allows us to utilize the Scripture and the tools of God’s divine power to engage the difficult strongholds of people’s lives, so that we can say, “Praised be our God, because it’s His divine power that destroys these strongholds and allows people to walk at peace with Him and at peace with others, to stand stable and sturdy.”\\nOver the next couple of days, we’re going to hear large doses of this from some amazing speakers that I’m so thankful would join us and address us on these topics. Dr. John Street from the Master’s University is going to talk about the role of the Holy Spirit in counseling. Listen, this is one of the issues that has been completely dismissed in integrated counseling theory and in secular counseling theory. We’ve tried to replace the role of the Holy Spirit. I cannot wait for you to hear Dr. Street address this issue.\\nPhilip De Courcy, Pastor at Kindred Community Church out in Southern California is going to address this issue: thinking about the superiority of Jesus over the demonic. We need to be reminded of Jesus’ superiority over the demonic, especially when our engagement is against the principalities and powers.\\nJohn MacArthur is going to join us as well, pastor at Grace Community Church. I’m so thankful that he’s able to address our attendees on the subject of thinking biblically about how Jesus handled spiritual warfare. How Jesus engaged in spiritual warfare. I know that is going to be an encouragement to us.\\nLance Quinn, who’s the pastor at Bethany Bible Church in Thousand Oaks, California, is going to help us to understand from James 1 the battles that we have with temptation. What an immense engagement in spiritual warfare, when we engage the temptations that we are lured and enticed by—our own passions and desires. Lance is going to help us understand that.\\nWe’re going to close out our time with Dr. Heath Lambert. Many of you know him. He was our executive director prior to my time here at ACBC. I’m so thankful for this brother. He’s going to help us to understand from Ephesians 6 spiritual warfare in the counseling room. He’s going to get really practical in his explanation.\\xa0I’m so thankful for his contribution as well.\\nCan I just mention a word about Dr. Heath Lambert? When we recorded all of our sessions a few weeks ago, we had no idea the Dr. Lambert was actually going to have to go into brain surgery. On September 18th, that’s exactly what he did. He is recovering well, praise the Lord for that, but brain surgery is brain surgery and so we want to pray for his continued recovery, for his church First Baptist Jacksonville, and the ministry that he’s doing there and the men and women that he serves with. Would you pray for him and Lauren and his family as he recovers? I’m so thankful that he was able to contribute this year as well.\\nI’m so grateful and thankful for all of our speakers, but I want to mention to you—for those of you who now are feeling somewhat left out. Hey, we have something for you that you can purchase this content that will be delivered over the next couple of days. You can purchase this content from our website store. This is the first time that we’ve ever done a digital conference and the quality has been tremendous. I’m so thankful for it. This is probably the best quality that we’ve ever had in content that we’ve delivered in both an audio and a video format. Now, one thing to remember is we are coming out with a new website, which I cannot wait to tell you about more in the near future. That’s going to release sometime in November and this content will be available on our website store in November when our new website releases. That’s going to be so helpful and so handy for all of you.\\nKeep this in mind. I pray that you will desire this content and want this content because we have these six plenary speakers and about 50 breakout sessions that are addressing similar topics from the Word of God that I know you’re going to want to learn more about.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nSpiritual Warfare\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

      "{'title': 'The Weapons of Our Warfare', 'subtitle': 'Destroying Strongholds', 'author': 'Mark Williams', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Spiritual Warfare 5', 'question': 'Though the enemy is strong and the walls are high, we have a God who is stronger and higher.', 'body': 'Joshua fought the battle of Jericho, and the walls came a-tumbling down! I remember singing this song in our Bible class when I was a kid. It was always fun to sing about how the Israelites walked around a city, blew trumpets, yelled, and then the great walls fell down. Now, years later, the historical account found in Joshua 6 has taken on more meaning as I have counseled those struggling with life’s most difficult problems. There was something incredible and supernatural at work in that story and it gives insight into the ministry and spiritual warfare that Paul writes about in his letter to the Corinthians.\\nFor though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. \\xa0For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. \\xa0We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ,\\xa0being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete. – 2 Corinthians 10:3-6\\nPaul is defending and defining his ministry to the Corinthians in this passage. In his definition, he explains three things about his ministry that is true of all ministry:\\nFirst, we are at war. As believers in this world, we live as “actors in the theatre of war.”1David Powlison, Power Encounters: Reclaiming Spiritual Warfare. (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1995), 20. Living in a fallen world, we have dangers from sin in ourselves, in others, and in the world systems. There is the constant prowl of the devil over the earth looking for whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8). Paul uses military imagery frequently in his letters to emphasize the intensity of the Christian life (Philippians 2:25, Ephesians 6:10-20, 2 Timothy 2:3-4). Clearly, the Christian walk is one fraught with the struggles of war.\\nSecond, we must use the right weapons. Our weapons need to be sufficient for the battle at hand. Paul, here, explains that fleshly weapons will not work. The weapons we need must have divine power in order to be effective. So, what are these divinely empowered weapons? They are the true words of God, the Scriptures, the one offensive weapon in the full armor of God provided for his soldiers (Ephesians 6:13-20). Life giving words. True words (John 17:17). Discerning words (Hebrews 4:12). God’s words (2 Timothy 3:16). Make no mistake, these weapons have divine power “designed by God,” and they are meant to be wielded by God’s people.2Jay E. Adams, 1 & 2 Corinthians. The Christian Counselor’s Commentary. (Hackettstown, NJ: Timeless Texts, 1994), 160. Jericho’s walls would not have fallen if God’s people did not obey His command. And no amount of shouting and trumpet blasts would have made the walls crumble if it were not commanded by God.\\nThird, the weapons are meant to accomplish a specific task; to destroy strongholds. In war, battles are won when strongholds are conquered. But what are these strongholds?\\xa0 Paul says they are “arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God.” (1 Corinthians 10:4) Owen Strachan used the term “Intellectual Castles” to illustrate the meaning of this term.3Owen Strachan, Destroying Arguments, Residency Lecture at Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary on January 23, 2019. They are fortresses of human wisdom, including any knowledge that tries to usurp the place of God’s Word. Ultimately, they are false teachings, lies, and counterfeit truths. Like Jericho, these walls are high and formidable, and those who look at them stand in awe. Yet, these walls of worldly wisdom cannot stand before the Almighty God. The wisdom of the world is foolishness to God (1 Corinthians 3:19). These strongholds can be public worldviews and teachings, but they can also be personal. Public strongholds are erected by the world. Personal strongholds are those we erect in our own sinfulness. We can build strongholds in our lives from things that we elevate above Christ and they will demand our allegiance. These sinful habits which started out small now make slaves of God’s people (Romans 6:16). Like the pagan idols raised up in the place of God (2 Kings 21) we construct these strongholds and give them the praise, adoration, and worship that belong to God alone. God’s divine Word, His weapon given to us, is meant to be used to tear down these walls and destroy the idols, never again to be rebuilt.\\nWhat Does All This Mean for Biblical Counseling?\\nIn a recent sermon, pastor Timothy Juhnke made this statement: “You cannot accomplish God’s work with man’s means.”4Timothy Juhnke, Sermon at Faith Community Church, Kansas City, MO on August 25, 2019. In biblical counseling, we are committed to accomplishing God’s work using God’s means. We counsel in the power of the Holy Spirit with the Holy Scriptures.\\nMinistry is war. Counseling is a battle. Not with flesh and blood, but with spiritual powers of darkness (Ephesians 6:12). Counselees’ lives have been taken captive to lies from within and without, therefore biblical counselors have a responsibility to take up arms and help destroy strongholds.\\nWe have the greatest weapon. Scripture wielded in the hands of a believer who is empowered by the Holy Spirit has divine power to destroy strongholds. John MacArthur says “that spiritual warfare is fought with spiritual weapons … not fleshly techniques, theories, and therapies.”5John MacArthur, Our Sufficiency in Christ. (Dallas, TX: Word Pub, 1991), 111. No other weapon is needed. No outside sources are necessary to help in the battle. Worldly wisdom need not interfere. God’s Word alone can accomplish God’s will in God’s way for God’s glory.\\nWalls will fall. When a biblical counselor presents the Scriptures in counseling, walls of doubt, temptation and sin can fall, strongholds of worldly ideologies, lies and life dominating problems can be taken, and lives of men and women can be transformed.\\nGod has provided us with His “precious and very great promises” (2 Peter 1:4) to use to tear down strongholds. Though the enemy is strong and the walls are high, we have a God who is stronger and higher. In the words of Charles Spurgeon, “keep firmly to this: ‘God said it, God promised it; God cannot lie, whose very word of grace is strong as that which built the skies.’”6C. H. Spurgeon, Spiritual Warfare in a Believer’s Life. (Lynnwood, WA: Emerald Books, 1993), 81.\\xa0Let us continue to fight the battle, trusting in God and His Word.\\n\\n\\n\\nTopics:\\nSpiritual Warfare\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Williams served as Membership Services Coordinator at ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",
      "{'title': 'How Should Christians Think About Demonic Activity?', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 22', 'author': 'Amy Evenson  Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Spiritual Warfare 5', 'question': 'The devil is a real foe and he is a defeated foe. We serve a King who is able to keep His people safe.', 'body': 'Heath Lambert: A common question that many Christians have is about the nature of the devil and demonic activity in the Christian life to help us think through some of the questions that people are asking, Amy Evensen, the producer of Truth in Love, is here to ask some of the questions that are on people’s minds.\\nAmy Evensen: So in the Christian life, we’re thinking about sin and suffering and different things going on, but demons aren’t always on the forefront of our minds. So, could you talk about whether demons are real and do they pose an actual problem for Christians?\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, I think that’s a good question, and I think you’re right. I think that Christians do find it easy to think about threats from the world and sins that they struggle with. And maybe sometimes the spiritual forces of darkness, which are so often invisible, are not something that we think about with a lot of intentionality. And so, just to answer the question, are demons real? Is the devil real? The answer to that question is yes. And the answer to that question is yes because the Bible is so clear that the devil does exist. And the Bible’s clear about this in a lot of places, but one place where the Bible is crystal clear is in 1 Peter 5. And in verse 8 it says, “be sober-minded, be watchful, your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.” So the Bible says, the devil is real. And in fact, the Bible compares the devil to a lion and he uses the work of devouring or of a lion consuming his prey to characterize the work of the devil. The devil goes about doing to people, doing to Christians what lions do to the prey that they eat. And so this is meant to be a shocking analogy from the apostle Peter to arrest us and help us think very seriously about the kind of awful, terrible work that the devil is engaged in. And then it doesn’t just say that the devil devours people. It says that he’s prowling around. So the devil—the forces of darkness—is on the move, he is looking for people to attack. He is looking for people to consume and so Christians absolutely need to take this, not just seriously, but deadly serious.\\nAmy Evensen: So if the devil is so active and deadly, how would you recognize this activity?\\nHeath Lambert: Well, this question is just as important as the first one, because if the devil is real but misdiagnosed in our lives, then we are not going to be much help. There are errors on both sides. Christians can attribute activity that has nothing to the devil to the devil and then at other times, Christians can fail to see when the devil is active in a situation. And so the only way that we’re going to be able to sort this out is through texts of Scripture. And the Bible actually speaks with a lot of clarity about the manifestations of the devil in this world and in our life. And there are more descriptions in the Bible about this than we have time to talk about in our podcast. But maybe I just talk about a few examples in the Scriptures that we see of demonic activity. So when we see these examples, we would be able to recognize at least a few of the ways that the devil is involved in our lives in a really harmful way.\\nOne example in the Bible is that the devil is active in evangelism. So in Matthew 13:18, Jesus is telling the parable of the sower and he is talking about the seed that is thrown on the hard path. That is, the Gospel is preached and unbelievers don’t hear it. They don’t understand it. It does not affect them. And Jesus tells us what’s going on there in Matthew 13:18 and the following. He says, “hear then the parable of the sower. When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.” And so Jesus says that every time we hear the Gospel preached and unbelievers do not hear it—they don’t understand it—that is the work of demonic activity. So we need to see the devil as a real foe in our evangelistic work. That’s one example.\\nAnother example is the activity of the devil in sickness and illness. We see this in Matthew 17, is one example, there are many examples of this in the gospels, but in Matthew 17:14 and following this is what Jesus says, “when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and kneeling before him said, ‘Lord have mercy on my son for he’s an epileptic and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire and often into the water and I brought him to your disciples and they could not heal him.’ And Jesus answered, ‘Oh faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me.’ And Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him and the boy was healed instantly.” This is a text. Honestly, that could make us feel uncomfortable because what we have here is a demonic activity that only manifests as physical weakness, as illness. There’s no indication, there are no voices, there’s no strange behavior like breaking of chains or anything like that. This is somebody who is having epileptic seizures and we would not know that a demon is involved in this illness if we didn’t see Jesus, right here in the pages of Scripture, exercising the demon. And so this gives us humility here. Let me say what this does not mean, it doesn’t mean that the devil is behind each and every instance of physical illness. It certainly doesn’t mean that the devil is involved in every instance of epilepsy. But what it does mean is that a uniquely Christian view of illness understands that the devil is involved in some of these and we need to trust the Word of God here and go with it.\\nAnother example of demonic activity is the devil’s involvement in marriage. And so in 1 Corinthians 7, which is a passage that is famously about marriage, Paul is talking about rules for marriage. He’s telling the Corinthians that the bodies of husbands don’t belong only to them, but to their wives and the bodies of wives don’t belong only to them, but to their husbands. And he tells them to enjoy the marriage bed with regularity and he says in verse five, “do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a limited time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, but then come together again so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.” And so this is a place where the Bible is telling us that the devil as he prowls around, is looking to devour marriages. In particular, he is looking for married couples who are not having sex together in a regular way.\\nMany more examples, but here’s just one more; we see the devil is involved in conflict in churches. So, in 2 Timothy 2:24 to the end it says, “the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone, able to teach patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness, God may perhaps grant them repentance, leading to a knowledge of the truth and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil after being captured by him to do his will.” So this is an astounding text that tells us that sometimes much of the conflict that we see in our churches is actually driven by the devil. There are people who’ve been captured by the devil to incite a quarrelsome spirit in the church. And so pastors are actually doing battle against the devil in many cases when they respond with gentleness to quarrelsome people in the church. So, those are four categories that Christians are living in all the time—evangelism, illness, marriage, and conflict—where the Bible tells us the devil is often right in the middle of each one of those.\\nAmy Evensen: How should Christians think about and respond to demons?\\nHeath Lambert: Yeah, I appreciate the question because it’s not enough to acknowledge that. The devil is real, to see some of the ways that he acts, but then not know how to respond. And so it’s interesting in that first text that I was reading in 1 Peter 5:8, which talks about the devil prowling around like a roaring lion, it goes on to say in verse nine, “resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.” Here, and in Ephesians 6, Christians are encouraged that we defeat the devil through faith, we defeat the devil through trusting the Lord. There is not some special biblical response to the devil that’s different than the biblical response that we have to our sins or to our suffering or to the attacks of the world. We respond to the devil the way we respond to all difficulties, which is by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. We trust that in a world where the devil is a real and powerful enemy, he is also a defeated enemy because of the blood of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ defeated the forces of darkness in His work on the cross and so we need to be sobered by the existence of the devil. That’s what first Peter 5:8 tells us to do, we need to be sober-minded. But we should not be scared. We should not believe that the devil is in charge in some meaningful way. He is a real foe, but he is a defeated foe. God has him on a leash and so we can trust that though the devil is a real enemy, a dangerous enemy, we serve a king who has defeated that enemy and who even in the midst of very real dangers is able to keep His people safe forever as we trust in Him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nSpiritual Warfare\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmy Evenson is the Executive Assistant to Dr. Heath Lambert at\\xa0First Baptist Church\\xa0in\\xa0Jacksonville, Florida.                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n",

      "{'title': 'Resisting Temptation from Psalm 63', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 451', 'author': 'Dale Johnson  Keith Evans', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Temptation 6', 'question': 'How do we, from the Scriptures, counsel others to resist temptation?', 'body': 'Dale Johnson: This week on the podcast, I’m delighted to have with me, Keith Evans. He’s the Associate Professor of Biblical Counseling at the Reformed Theological Seminary in Charlotte, North Carolina. He’s been in pastoral ministry for twelve years, and this is his sixth academic year as a professor at a seminary in higher education. He began pastoral ministry in Lafayette, Indiana before being called back to his alma mater to teach. Keith is married to his wife Melissa for 17 years, and they have four daughters.\\nWe’re talking about resisting temptation. It’s really important for us when we think about temptation or struggles in life, that we always reset our experiences, what we’re feeling, what we’re behaving like, symptoms in to the context of Scripture. We’re going to talk about that in relation to Psalm 63. Psalm 63 and resisting temptation. How do you see the connection between those two things, from temptation and this particular psalm?\\nKeith Evans: It was actually a Reformed Baptist minister of the 1700s who helped me see this connection. Some of the listeners are probably familiar with John Gill. He preached in Spurgeon’s pulpit a hundred years before Spurgeon preached in that pulpit. So he made it famous before Spurgeon did. But in his commentary on this psalm, he makes the connection in the superscript, the comment on the psalm, a psalm of David, when he was in the Judean Wilderness. He makes the connection with Christ when He was in the Judean Wilderness during His time of temptation, so it was really John Gill who helped me see that. If that’s the case, then what we have here is a prophetic image of the inner dialogue and wrestlings of the Messiah as he’s resisting temptation. It gives the psalm a whole new clarity of resisting temptation. It’s kind of like Psalm 22, as the Messiah hangs on the cross, “My God, my God. Why have you forsaken me?” We see this inner dialogue prayer, wrestling with the Truth of God, as He’s making atonement for us. That’s how Gill was seeing Psalm 63: that it’s not just the wrestlings of David as he was driven out of Jerusalem by Absalom, but prophetically, it’s the inner wrestlings of Christ as He’s wrestling in the Judean Wilderness of, “Is God fully satisfying? Is He meeting my needs?” And how He’s resisting.\\nDale Johnson: Now, I need you to go a little bit further as we talk about seeing Jesus in the psalm. Some people are listening, and they’re saying, “What? Jesus wasn’t born yet. We’ve not gotten a Matthew. We’re still in the Old Testament.” Help us to understand how we see the temptation of Jesus in this particular psalm.\\nKeith Evans: The New Testament’s regularly looking back to the Psalms, seeing how they are prophetic, how they are Messianic. I mentioned Psalm 22, of course, as the classic one. But we see many others, that being the case as well. But Jesus himself when He’s walking on the road to Emmaus, teaching His disciples, He’s unpacking the Psalms, mentions the Psalms specifically, as well as the Law and Moses and so forth. But the Psalms speak of Him. If we just think of the imagery in Psalm 63, that in Psalm 63, there’s that wrestling. Day and night, the Lord sufficiently satisfying in a dry and weary land, hungering to the point of near starvation and saying “my soul is satisfied with rich food, satisfied with every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.” Did you hear these images and these echoings?\\nIn Mark’s gospel, we see that He was surrounded by wild beasts when Jesus was tempted. We see that same image in Psalm 63 that, “I will not be made prey of the jackals, it is my enemies who will be prey of the jackals.” And then we see the three images of the temptation. The Temptation with regard to bread, temptation with the sanctuary, the temptation of the glory of the kingdoms. We see all of those motifs in this psalm, as well. We see the image of the sanctuary, we see who is the true King and those who trust in the true king, they’ll be exalted. Again, whether or not He’ll be satisfied with all that God supplies and that He has sufficient, rich food for his soul. So all three of the temptation motifs are present in this psalm. At the very end of the psalm, He’s comforting himself that the enemy, the liar and all those along with the liar, their mouths will be made to stop and that He will be victorious.\\nDale Johnson: So Keith, you’ve worked us through a little bit, helping us to identify this temptation of Jesus, how it resonates with so much in the gospels. How does this help us to see how Christ resisted temptation in the Judean Wilderness more fully than just the gospel accounts that we see in places like Matthew, for example?\\nKeith Evans: The gospels present a straightforward presentation of the combat between Christ and the devil. This psalm takes us into that inner wrestling, just like I was talking about with Psalm 22, Christ making atonement for us and we see the prayer, His wrestlings with His Father, His application of these promises as He’s making atonement for us. So, too, this psalm. We know that He used Scripture to resist the devil, but here, we see how He’s applying it, how He’s trusting these things. It’s more than just quoting Scripture back to the tempter, He is doing that. But He’s applying these realities to His life as He’s seeing with eyes of sight, that potential conflict between what He’s been promised by His Father. So He’s counseling His own heart in the midst of the temptation with what is true. He’s praying these truths back to His Father, He’s seeing with eyes of faith as He’s resisting.\\nWhat’s He remembering? As He seeing all of these rocks and He knows that He has a good Father who, when He asks for bread, He doesn’t give Him a stone. And yet, that’s what Satan is tempting Him with and He’s saying, “No, I’m satisfied with the choicest of foods from my Father’s hand. I have what I want and what I need.” As He’s being offered all of the kingdoms in the moment of an eye, He’s remembering the true King and all those who trust in the King and swear by Him, they will rejoice, they will be exalted. “I won’t be cast down, I’m not going to be made food for the wild beasts and no, I will not die out here in the Judean Wilderness.” He’s counseling Himself with these promises, with these truths, when His reality appears different than those promises. It’s a true battling, it’s a true resisting and it’s in the inner man.\\nDale Johnson: We’re about to talk about application, but before we do that, I want to highlight for our listeners one of the most important things Keith has demonstrated for you. Before we get to the application, we’re going to dive into Scripture and understand the passage itself well. From that, we start to see application, we start to see methodology, how we can utilize these particular truths in the counseling room. Keith, even as you were talking, I’m thinking of lots of applications in my own life personally. I’m thinking of applications of what these truths mean for people that I counsel. I want you to highlight and give some specific applications that you see here to our resisting of temptation.\\nKeith Evans: The main underlying thing here we see in Psalm 63 that David is speaking to, that Christ is inner-wrestling, that He is speaking to, we are being offered in the temptation, something else that’s alluring, something else that’s shiny, something else that’s drawing us away. The underlying theme is God fully satisfies. That’s what we need to keep coming back to and continue to remember and remind ourselves of the cost of yielding. There’s a genuine cost, yet the infinite value of the alternative that I get God, I get the relationship with God, I get the all-satisfying joy of Him and relationship with Him. Temptation is always saying, “I’m going to find satisfaction, I’m going to find enjoyment in something else.” And this psalm is saying, “No. Look at the infinite value of the alternative.”\\nThis is a real battle here. This is a real inward-resisting. It’s not just this external, “I just need to say no,” or something like that. We also see recognizing the lies, rejecting the shortcut, as Christ rejected the shortcut to all the kingdoms of the world, patiently walking the long arduous path of the disciple, knowing the Spirit’s providential leading. Some translations of verse 8, Psalm 63 says, “My spirit follows after Your Spirit.” We know in the temptation of Christ, it’s the Spirit who drove Him into the wilderness, that there’s this providential leading that we forget that in temptation as well that, the Spirit is permitting us to be tempted for our strengthening and that He also gives all that is necessary to resist the temptation. All these things that we see highlighted here by the psalm I think are so helpful.\\nDale Johnson: As we bring this full circle and take us into the counseling room. How do we use this type of psalm with this rich teaching example, even of our Lord, to help counselees resist, as Christ also resisted temptation?\\nKeith Evans: I think the one that I mentioned: knowing the lies, seeing the lies. We need to know our particular lures. We need to know what tempts us. What was Christ being tempted with? With the kingdoms of the world that He came to purchase by His blood. What a sinister temptation that really is. Satan knows, terrifyingly, what tempts us. He’s using it in Christ’s case; he’s using it in our case. We need to see those lies.\\nSecondly and again, underlying this entire psalm, is that we need to see that this is a battle for our affections, a battle for our loves, a battle for what satisfies. To quote another old dead guy, I referenced John Gill before, but Thomas Chalmers, a Presbyterian from the 1800s, preached a famous sermon, “The Expulsive Power of a New Affection,” that what drives away the lures and the temptations of the evil one, is seeing this greater affection, this greater love for Christ and I think that’s what this psalm is holding out to us and we need to hold out to our counselees. It’s not just knowing Scripture. It is knowing Scripture but it’s walking with Christ, it’s loving Christ, it’s fellowshipping with Him and seeing that He is all satisfying to our soul and so much more satisfying than whatever the devil’s offering us.\\nDale Johnson: I love diving into particular psalms like this and how you’ve tied this, as the Scripture does, to the New Testament and what an encouragement for us to take away from the Scripture and make it immediately applicable to those who are sitting in front of us in the counseling room. Keith, this has been great.

He has been there for 26 years, and praise the Lord John for your faithfulness and your work there. I’m sure it’s always been simple, right? Certainly not as you pastor a community, but there’s something to be said about pastors who stick with the role and the work long term and the benefit that it is to the church for stability, for teaching, for consistency. I’m so grateful we get to see in ACBC some of the benefits or the fruit of that long-term ministry by so many of the counselors that we see going through our process and the quality that they are and their devotion to the ministry there in Sharpsburg. That’s just a beautiful thing for me. I want to say thank you for that, thank you for your faithfulness. Faith Bible Church is one of our training centers in the United States. And so, I’m just grateful for the way that John leads. \\nToday what I want him to do is to sort of build off of a book that he wrote recently called Hope: Living Confidently in God. I wanted us to continue a conversation and specifically look at passages, the specific passage in the Scripture that really helps us to understand the beauty of hope and how hope is intrinsically helpful no matter what scenario, particularly for our case today, when we’re talking about temptations, in our own temptations and then the temptations of our counselees. John, I’m grateful that you’re here to help us work through this. And so, where I want us to start, if we can, is just to help set the context for the passage that we’re going to be talking about today. 1 Corinthians 10:13, it’s a familiar passage to many, but reminds us of the context here.\\xa0\\nJohn Crotts: Sure, in 1 Corinthians chapter 10, it kind of starts out with avoiding Israel’s mistakes. They had great spiritual privileges at the beginning of chapter 10, but then they had miserable results of sin, and Paul wanted the Corinthians to know, hey, these are relevant examples; it’s not just a Sunday School story. This is real, they sinned, and they received punishment from God. And so, when he gets to verse 12, “therefore, let anyone who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall,” then we come to our sweet promise itself. One of my favorite verses in the whole Bible. “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man, God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. But with the temptation, he will provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it.” And so, we’re cautious and humbled by the negative examples of Israel, and he tells them don’t be so sure of itself. If it happened to you, it can happen to them. And so, then we come to our pastoral word of encouragement. Our word of hope.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: So, how in the world do we use a verse like this? And the reason I ask is because, you know, we can easily read a passage like this and sort of take it out of context, not understand its primary aim, and maybe even misapply especially when we’re talking about a counseling context of misapplying. I think many of us are probably familiar with some of the ways that this verse has been misapplied over time but helps us to work through a proper understanding certainly and then a proper application of how we can use this verse in an appropriate way to provide hope.\\xa0\\nJohn Crotts:\\xa0Right. Well, I do definitely agree that sometimes I’ve heard people almost use verses like magic verses, like if you say these words enough times, then your problems will go away or something like that. And really, the way that the Bible transforms us is by changing the patterns of our thinking and our attitudes, which brings about a change of heart and life direction. It all kind of flows from thinking biblically. So, I’ve kind of compared a verse like this to like a piece of hard candy, which, as you think about it and you’re sort of sucking on it. It turns your tongue the color of the candy, we’ve certainly seen that with our kids over the years, and then even like when we just take a cough drop or something like that. Well, we want to suck on this verse in the sense of thinking about it and meditating on it so that we can draw out as we steep our hearts to change the metaphor, it’s like the whole liquid turns to the tea, and we want these truths to change the way we’re thinking about the problems that we’re going through.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: Now, I think that’s actually a perfect explanation even for your book is you talk about in 31 sorts of small bite-sized pieces things that you’re just marinating over, mulling over on a consistent basis where the Lord really has an opportunity when we’re meditating on this idea of hope to change a person’s heart in a very different direction. And so, I think that’s a perfect example. So, talk about some of the wrong ways that we sometimes think of the uniqueness of our trials, the uniqueness of these temptations that we experience.\\nJohn Crotts:\\xa0Right. Well, this verse deals with that directly as it begins, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man,” so we need to see that the truth of God’s Word says your promises, your temptations are never unique, and some of the lies we tell ourselves is nobody knows the troubles I’ve seen, nobody knows my sorrow, no one understands. This is way too difficult for me. If you were going through what I was going through, you wouldn’t be so positive and hopeful, but no, that’s not true at all. Our temptations are common to man. That doesn’t mean every one of us experiences every temptation, but you’ll never experience any kind of temptation or trial that is just specifically for you that no one else can identify, even we think of our Lord Jesus in Hebrews 4:15, “he was tempted in all things like we are yet without sin.” And Hebrews 2:18 “He’s able to come to our aid.” Our temptations aren’t unique. There are even the same sorts of things that Jesus experienced as well in His earthly ministry.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0And I think what happens often is when we become convinced in our minds deceptively so that whatever trial or difficulty we’re working through is unique to us. It has an isolating effect, and that’s really the work of the evil one, right? Where the evil one wants to isolate us as if we’re the only ones working through this, no one has ever been at this particular junction in their life before. And that to me is the work of evil one, the roaring lion seeking whom he may devour; he’s trying to isolate you and allow you to be deceived and disconnected from the truth and from other people from fellowship and that sort of thing. So, yeah, I think that’s an important point that for all of us, there’s nothing new under the sun. We walk through trials that other people have experienced as well.\\nNow, let’s turn the corner and talk a little bit about from this passage. How does God’s character really inspire hope that our trials will never be unbearable because listen, the truth of the matter is, when you’re in the middle of difficulty, man, it seems like this day is going to turn into the next, and is going to turn into the next and how in the world am I going to live the rest of my life like this, or whatever, and it just seems like it is an unbearable wait. So, how do we look at the character of God to really inspire hope during these times?\\nJohn Crotts:\\xa0Isn’t it so important that when we’re ministering to people getting God in their thinking is such an important component of our ministry, and that’s what Paul does right in the middle of the verse: God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. And so, he points the readers, and by application to us to the faithfulness of God, it’s not just you and your problem. God is there. What’s God doing? What’s He up to? And He is faithfully working out His plan. He cares for you, He will not let you be overwhelmed. Your temptation is not going to be unbearable, not because the world might not keep spinning in a bad direction, but because God is faithful, and He will make it to where it will never be overwhelming. So, if you’ve been tempted to say, I can’t take it anymore; it’s too tough. I might as well just sin and get it over with. Well, the answer to those kinds of wrong thinking is to soak the truth of God’s character in your mind at this point. No, even if it feels like it’s overwhelming, God’s Word says it’s not unbearable.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0Now, you just mentioned, I think an important point is somehow, when we get in the middle of trials, we can be so easily deceived that we just think, “well, I’ll just throw in the towel. I’m going to give in. I’m tired of fighting this.” And we fall into the very temptation that seems unbearable at the moment, and somehow we convince ourselves that maybe this is the best route or man, I’m not sure that I can believe what God says that He’s going to allow me to bear up under the weight of something like this. So, why in the world is this wrong thinking?\\xa0\\nJohn Crotts:\\xa0Well, the verse concludes with yet another glorious promise that your temptation always has a way of escape. It ends with, “but with the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape that you may be able to endure it.” And so, even though it seems like, and it feels like it’s inevitable that I’m just going to go ahead and sin, so I might as well get it over with. That’s not true. That’s a lie. And we want to capture those lying thoughts, and we want to replace them with what the Bible says is true. And so, we remind ourselves of promises just like this. Now, this doesn’t mean that God will make the temptation go away completely, instantly as we would wish, but it does mean that he will give you grace to keep going through this thing. You don’t have to sin. He will always give you grace to honor Him in the trial.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0You know, that reminds me of a passage of Scripture that I’ve been thinking about the last several days, in Psalm 27:14, and what you’re describing there is us learning to be patient even in our temptations, even in our trials that we learn to wait for the Lord, the Bible says, be strong and let your heart take courage, wait for the Lord. It teaches us just a holy pattern of patience and hoping that God will make a way even when it doesn’t seem to be possible, so I love that.\\nNow, let’s take this into the counseling room. We can take it in certainly application to ourselves, but take it into the counseling room as we’re ministering to others. What are some of the ways that these promises become applicable, and useful in the way in which we minister to other people?\\xa0\\nJohn Crotts:\\xa0I think that these promises help our counselees to have a sense of reality. This is a biblical framework for viewing their circumstances. They can understand the reality of their situation better. This is not unique, this is not unbearable. I’m not trapped. It also points them to the reality of themselves, as they get so focused and they don’t realize God is working in this, and they see the reality of God. He’s faithfully involved all the way, God was with you at the beginning of this trial; it was customized by God, He knew what you can handle, and He assures you He’s not bringing this to overwhelm you. He’s there with you in the middle of your trial. He’s there with you at the end of the trial.\\nAnother way that this is useful is encouragement. I can make it like we’ve been talking about hope. I’ll never be overwhelmed. I’ll always have an escape. God is intimately involved with my circumstances. There’s another way that this verse helps us as well is the conviction of sin because if it’s not overwhelming, and if it’s not unique, that means when I do sin, I’m not just a victim of my circumstances. I have to be accountable and deal again with the reality that, no, I’m not a victim here. God has promised that it wouldn’t be overwhelming. So, therefore, when I just gave in to that sin again, I need to repent. I need to own that. So, it’s humbling. It’s encouraging, it’s comforting, a promise like this is gold, just gold, and so I would think this is one that we need to have close at hand as we minister, even just over the back of the pew on Sunday morning, this is one that’s so relevant because everybody’s going through something and if they’re not, they will be next week. So, in addition to just thinking rightly, I would really encourage anyone in personal ministry to memorize 1 Corinthians 10:13. It’s going to be a helpful tool for you, but you want it right by your side to be ready to pull out and minister to your brother or sister in need.\\xa0\\nDale Johnson: I mean, this is so helpful, John. I think of Paul’s encouragement in Colossians let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. And this is certainly one of the passages that, as you dwell on it personally it changes you, but it also engages you in ministry to others so that you can provide hope even when they’re walking through difficulty.\\nSo brother, thank you for this. This has been great to hear a little bit about your book but specifically dive into a passage that really fuels our idea of hope. And that we have hope specifically in God, not in our circumstances, not in our trials. It’s very pastoral. I love when we dive into passages like this, and it becomes applicable immediately for our listeners, and for our counselors. So, thank you, brother.\\n\\nHelpful Resources:\\nYou can find more information about ACBC’s retreat for pastors and their wives here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nTemptation\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDale Johnson serves as the Executive Director of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors.

Lance is one of our board members here at ACBC. Many of you are familiar with Lance in his pastoral ministry and his ministry to ACBC throughout the years. He serves faithfully. I love this brother. He’s so helpful to me in my role here as Executive Director.\\nA little bit about Lance, he prepared for vocational ministry at several different institutions.

What blessings, Lance.\\nIt’s so great to have you here on the podcast to talk about this particular subject, which is so needed. Thank you brother for joining us.\\nLance Quinn:\\xa0Great to be here with you, Dale.\\nDale Johnson: Lance, you delivered a talk not long ago at our Annual Conference, which this year we had to do in a digital format. In your plenary session at our Annual Conference, you spoke about this particular issue of temptations from James 1. You spoke about the fact that the Greek word in the biblical text in the context of James 1 that’s often translated “test,” “temptation,” or “trial” is actually the same word.\\xa0 What then is the theological and practical difference between this idea of a “test” from God or a “temptation” from Satan given that it’s the same word that’s used both for positive, helpful tests from God Himself versus a negative type of destructive temptation from Satan?\\nLance Quinn: Well, that’s a great question. This particular first chapter of the letter from James, our Lord Jesus’ brother, is a very important biblical passage for counselors. And obviously even for just Christians in general. You and I might be familiar with the first couple of verses in James 1 beginning in verse 2, “Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”\\nThe word there for trials, as you mentioned Dale, is actually a word that is used in a negative context in this chapter for “temptations,” but it’s the same Greek word. In a positive context like here in verses 2-4, it’s talking about trials because all Christians go through trials. And the one who brings such trials is God Himself. We know that because verse 5 says, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.” God does bring trials. He tests Christians in order to bolster their faith, to bring steadfastness, to bring endurance. So the idea of trials comes from God to mature us, to make a steadfast, to give us a bolstered faith so that we might grow into the likeness of Christ.\\nBut if you go down in James 1 particularly to verse 13, you have a very different word in our English translation. I’m using the English Standard Version, but it’s the same Greek word peirasmos. In verse 13 it says, “Let no one say when he is tempted.” Well, that’s the same word as trials. Immediately, what we’re hearing is a different context and in this context you’re talking about someone who is battling sin in their heart. How do we know that? Well, it says in verse 14-15, “But each person is tempted [there’s that word again] when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.” Two different contexts—the first being positive, the next being negative, but it’s the same Greek word peirasmos.\\nWhen God is bringing such a trial, He never solicits us to do evil. When it’s in a negative context, that same word is in a sense transformed into a very negative one, so that it ceases to be just a trial, but it’s a temptation. Here in James 1, it actually doesn’t mention Satan—at least by name. It doesn’t say, “Satan is leading you to be tempted into sin.” It actually says when we’re tempted, we are led or lured or enticed by our own desire, which of course means I don’t need Satan to be a sinner. James does mention Satan in other contexts (even in James 4:7 it says, “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you”), but here it’s talking about the Christian who is tempted by his own desire. When that word peirasmos is used, it does mean tempt, and not just trial, because it’s coming from a source. In this case, the source is my own remaining sin, the sin of my heart.\\nThis is a very interesting chapter—one positive, one negative. The positive is that you and I are being led by God to be tested. That word tested in verses 2 and 3 is the word dokimos. It means to be approved, or to be tested, or to be refined in the fire, so that all of the dross, the impurities, my remaining sin, is burned away so that I can look just like my Savior Jesus Christ.\\nThis is a very important text for counselors. If I were to use this in a counseling context, I would explain what I’ve just said, but I would make sure Christians understand who need to be counseled, want to be counseled, that it is our desire that sometimes is our own worst enemy.\\nDale Johnson: You make several interesting points. I wish we could go back and talk through some of that. But as we think about the testing and the trial, you make an interesting distinction about what it produces. Does it produce something that’s healthy in relation to God, that’s righteous and good in us? Or does it produce something that’s evil according to our own desire? When the biblical writer—who you mention is actually James, the brother of our Lord—when he speaks in verses 1-5 about this testing of the Christian’s faith and what it produces as over against that idea of doubting, the doubting of the believer and what it produces.\\nHow can a biblical counselor practically use this passage in James 1 to encourage both the one trusting God in the midst of their trial, as over against the doubting believer who’s instability is wreaking havoc in his or her spiritual life?\\nLance Quinn: I think as a counselor, here’s the way I would approach that. If you are determining as you’re sitting across from someone or your discipling someone, and you’ve both got your Bible open to James 1. If it’s positive, if it’s coming to a believer who is grieved over their sin, they’re desiring to grow spiritually, they’re very sincere, I would take them to James 1:2-4. I would explain what we’ve just said in your first question and then I would go to verses 5 and 6, which says, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting.” I would say to that person who’s earnestly wanting to deal with their sin, I would encourage them that they can avail themselves of two things: wisdom and faith. This is why the Bible so practical for us!\\nThe wisdom that they don’t possess in order to deal with their trials—that wisdom comes from God. So what do you do? You pray and you ask God for wisdom. Now, I don’t think when you ask God for wisdom, He’s going to give you something out of the sky, as it were. He’s going to illumine your mind about passages of Scripture that you’ve read, that you’ve learned perhaps even as a child, from the sermons that your preacher may give you, your own Bible study, a friend’s encouragement giving you Bible verses that you can use in your own life.\\nHowever the vehicle of that wisdom comes, it’s you asking God for it and He brings (as I like to say) the Word of God, the Spirit of God, and the people of God to you. When you have that kind of wisdom, you will be directed to pursue this trial so that it produces in you an endurance in your Christian life. And you do it without doubting. You do that by asking God for an increased faith. Right there practically in verses 5 and 6, you’re being told what are the the tools that you have at your disposal: wisdom from God and faith that allows you, instead of doubting, to grow. Faith is like a muscle—increasing the strength of your understanding of what this trial is and it ultimately produces for you a kind of endurance.\\nNow when you turn it over in James 1:13-16 to the negative issues of someone having a desire for sin, and then that sin according to verse 14 is a sin that you’ve been lured and enticed into doing, which means that you have other forces at work. Your remaining sin in your heart that you have to deal with like a spiritual battle like no other, and you also have Satan and his devils who are fighting against you at every turn, and then of course you have just the allurements of the world. Do you see the opposites, here?\\nFor me, the idea is taking your counselee or your disciple and showing them the two ends of James 1, as it were. You show them the positive, you show them the steadfastness, the endurance, the wisdom, the faith. And then you show them the backend, and the backend is when you are tempted it is because you are lured and enticed by your own desires. Then you start talking to them about their motives, their desires, their will, those things that are leading them into sin. When they are aware of their motives, then you can begin to take them back to James 1:2-4, and you can show them how the positive can overcome the negative.\\nDale Johnson: That’s so helpful, and I’m even thinking about this for our counselors. This is how the wisdom of God should be the backdrop of how we see people’s lives. When an event is happening in their life, it’s not so much the event in-and-of-itself. God is really helping us to understand, it’s how people respond. I’ve always thought about that question that asked, “If any of you lacks wisdom.” That trial reveals something about us in our lack of the wisdom of God.\\nAs you mentioned toward the end, we see the negative. When in James 1:14-16, he speaks about this progression of temptation into sin, this is an important idea that we as counselors or pastors need to understand as you think about engaging with people. This idea that we are lured and then enticed to consider, to contemplate sinning, to respond not according the wisdom of God, but according to the wisdom of man or our own desires. Then our desire leads to sin and then sin to death, this type of progression.\\nHow does a person counsel someone else to prevent them from being on this slippery slope of progression of sin to death?\\nLance Quinn: Well, I think the first thing is what verse 16 says. That is, “Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.” Understand this: Sin is real, Satan is real, the world and its allurements are real. What are you putting into your mind? What are you saying as you coach yourself? Do you place God’s Word in your mind and heart so as to battle these forces of evil, including even the remaining sin of your heart? And if in fact, you are entertaining the subject matter of the world. What do you listen to? Who do you listen to? How much do you ingest God’s Word, as over against how much you ingest the world’s goods, the world’s philosophy of how to live life?\\nI would begin to ask someone that you’re discipling, counseling, “Tell me how much time you spend in God’s Word daily, versus how much time you spend with social media or television or some form of what you put through your eyes or your ears in terms of what your mind is apprehending.” In the end you will inevitably find, I think, a kind of temptation that has been grown in the soil of worldliness, of satanic enterprise, and a person’s own lustful desires. And if you can choke that off, if you can put the good kind of pesticide of God’s Word to choke out the worries, the strategies, the philosophies, and the temptations of the world, you’ll be a lot further along in accessing the wisdom of God through faith in Christ than you ever thought possible. And you’re going to be even then more greatly victorious as you see a growth in grace and a precipitous fall from those things that once fell you in your sinful temptations.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0This is the important work that the Lord has called us to do in counseling, when we minister the Word. We can help someone to see when they’re on this progression and to warn them. As you were thinking, I could not help but the Word of the Lord coming to me from Colossians 3 that we let the word of Christ dwell in us richly and that be the backdrop by which we see the world. That way when trials come, we respond according to what’s in our heart in what we desire. We desire the Word of the Lord. It’s easy for all of us to start hearing the noise, the ideas that come from the world, and we get swept away in our desires.

      "{'title': 'Responding Biblically to Temptation', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 205', 'author': 'Dale Johnson  Lisa Schmidt', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Temptation 6', 'question': 'When facing temptation, Christians must be active in attacking their sins and pursuing righteousness.', 'body': 'Dale Johnson:\\xa0Today on the podcast, I am delighted to welcome Lisa Schmidt. She is a homeschool mom of 19 years. Prior to that, she served as a public school teacher. Now, interestingly, she is a member at Bible Presbyterian in Grand Island, New York. She is a counselor there and serves as a ladies Bible study teacher. She’s also enrolled as a Masters of Christian Ministry student at Western Reformed Seminary. We’re so glad that she’s here today to talk on this particular subject about temptation, how we think through temptation, and how we respond to temptation. We have so many questions about temptation especially for us as believers. We all deal with these types of issues in temptations to sin, Paul tells us we still live in this body of death and we struggle with this in many ways. Lisa, when we think through temptations, where do these temptations even come from?\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0Well, it’s interesting because before we even answer that question, what’s foundational for all of us as believers is to have a right understanding of who God is. Knowing who He is according to who He says He is and not who we think He is, is foundational to our growth in Christ. We have to have an accurate and biblical knowledge of Him and His attributes, and that can only be obtained by reading, studying, and meditating upon the Word of God, and hearing the proper preaching of the Word of God.\\nPsalm 119:9-16 says, “How can a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed according to Your Word. With my whole heart I have sought You.” Which begs the question, have I done that? Continuing on he says, “Oh, let me not wander from Your commandments! Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against You! Blessed are You, O Lord!\\xa0 Teach me Your statutes! With my lips I have declared all the judgments of Your mouth. I have rejoiced in the way of Your testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate on your precepts and contemplate Your ways. I will delight myself in Your statutes; I will not forget your word.”\\nSo to go back to your question, “Where do those temptations come from?” many well intentioned believers think that temptations come because of external circumstances, either external difficulties or blessings. Some people will refer to this as “the world.” “The world is influencing me.” It could be something like physical illness or it could even be physical health; financial difficulties or financial prosperity. It could be relationship struggles or even relationship joys.\\nMany people believe that their temptations come from an external spiritual opposition, if you will, the devil, and you’ll even hear people say, “Well, the devil made me do it.” The problem is, the Bible says something completely different from that. “The devil made me do it” is actually not a valid excuse for Christians. He may have tempted us, but he did not make us sin. We all choose to sin on our own, and God’s Word says that temptations actually come from our internal condition.\\nThat’s the answer to your question, “Where do these temptations come from?” They come from things such as our internal motivations, our cravings, our fears, our desires. We do have to be aware there, we do have a real enemy; the devil is there. First Peter 5:8 says that we are to be “sober and vigilant because our adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.” But then the hope comes from 1 Corinthians 10:13, which says, “No temptation has overtaken us except such as is common to man. But God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape that you may be able to bear it.” In going back to the initial point of understanding who God is based on who He says He is from the Word, we also need to take our instruction from His Word on how we are to properly, biblically handle the temptations when they come.\\nThe internal condition that I refer to is talked about very clearly in James 1:12-15, which says, “Blessed is the man who endures temptation; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him,” and here’s the key, “but each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed, then when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.” The key is in verse 14, “but each one is tempted when he is drawn away,” and this is, quite frankly, the part most of us don’t like, “drawn away by his own desires and enticed.” This is fishing language, and it’s meant to portray the image of a worm on a hook. It is the bait actually, when we’re enticed by something internally and we take that bait, and once we do, it gives birth to sin.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0We’ve identified a few places from which temptation comes. I know there are situations that I find myself in at times, maybe I’ve not gotten enough rest, or maybe I’ve not been as disciplined as I ought to in reading the Scriptures, or being around brothers and sisters in the Lord to encourage fellowship and to strengthen me, and we find ourselves being weak and much more vulnerable to temptation. Talk about when we are tempted.\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0Yes, and you bring up a good point that all of us deal with. The Bible is really clear, it tells us that we are tempted in both good times and bad times. It could be something as simple as, like you mentioned, “I’m just overtired I didn’t get enough sleep, so I’m tempted to be cranky with my kids or snap at my husband or even just the cashier at the grocery store. Or I’m angry while I’m driving because I’m late and I’m losing my patience.”\\nBut we can also be tempted in good times, and we’re tempted just as much in joyful, healthy, and prosperous times as we are in times of struggle and illness and poverty. The important part is knowing that temptations come from our own evil desires within. We should then be more aware to know when and what conditions make temptations arise typically for us, because you may be tempted in one area, Dale, where I do not particularly have that weakness, or vice versa.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0\\xa0To follow up with that, what are some of those conditions of temptation? I think that’s a critical point that you’re getting at there.\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0The first would be conditions that make our obedience challenging, and some of those conditions are unintentional, like a physical illness. It’s often really difficult for any of us to concentrate or focus on spiritual things when we’re suffering physically. This is one reason why it’s really important for us to thoughtfully consider how we can minister to those suffering with physical infirmities and illnesses around us, maybe by reaching out, sending a card, making a call, better yet visiting them in person, reading the Scriptures to them. This then begs the question, “Am I doing those things for myself? Am I staying in the Word? Am I staying prayerful? Am I seeking counsel in those areas when I’m tempted to sin?”\\nAnother condition that makes obedience challenging might be the loss of a loved one. A lot of people call into question the goodness of God in those times, especially if it was a sudden loss, something not expected. It could also be when we are struggling in our relationships, or maybe someone we love or know or ourselves even has lost a job, or there are other financial struggles.\\nThe other way that temptations arise is with conditions that make it easy for us to sin. We have to be really consciously aware and proactive not to put ourselves in situations that we know, personally for us, are trigger points. If over-tiredness typically leads to sin in our life, then it would be really wise for us to make sure we, as best we can, have a regular bedtime and we’re getting the proper rest that we need. Often, you’ll hear a lot of women say, “Oh, my husband is such a baby when he gets sick.” Well, that may be an area where he is particularly tempted to sin, because he’s created to work and work hard, so sickness really interferes with that, and we want to be sensitive to that as wives and then not use that as an excuse to sin against him.\\nConditions like spiritual laziness, not training ourselves with Bible reading or church attendance or serving in the church or prayer. Other conditions that make it easy to sin would be being with people who influence us to sin, we choose our friends very wisely. First Corinthians 15:33 is clear. It says, “Bad company corrupts good character.” Or going places that increase our temptation. As counselors, of course, we would never have to advise someone struggling with the sin of drunkenness to spend their time in a bar. We need to be really careful that we aren’t going places or spending time with people who cause us to sin. Even buying things, watching things, reading things, or listening to things that do not glorify God are things that can lead us to sin. In order to know how to best overcome temptation in our own life, we not only need to know when we’re tempted and what conditions make temptations arise, but we also really need to understand the stages of temptation.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0\\xa0Up to this point, you’ve laid the landscape to make us very aware of preventive care, thinking about temptation and how we can avoid it and things we can do to make sure that we’re walking with the Lord, that we’re aware of the way in which the evil one might tempt us. The Scriptures even tell us to know the schemes of the evil one, to pay attention to those things. Now we get to a little bit more practical discussion. You mentioned the stages of temptation. You talked about James 1 earlier. Walk us through some of the ideas that the Scripture gives on the stages of temptation.\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0It’s crucial that we train ourselves to recognize temptation on its onset, in its first stage. Most of us know what entices us, whether it is lust of the eye, lust of the flesh, or a lot of pride in our life. If we can recognize these things as soon as they present themselves, and we resist them, we really can avoid the downward spiral into sin. In James 1, the Lord outlines those three stages of temptation for us. In James 1:14, it says, “But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed,” and this would be best identified as the “seduction stage.” We are tempted when we are seduced and drawn away by our own evil desires. We take that bait and boom, conception of that evil desire occurs.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0\\xa0So, what you are saying is that Satan does not make us do this stuff.\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0That’s right. The devil made us do it is not a valid excuse for Christians. He tempts us, but it is something in our own evil desires that causes us to be enticed and then take the bait. That second step after seduction would be conception. James goes on in verse 1:15 when he says, “Then when desire has conceived,” there is conception, “it gives birth to sin.” Once conception of that evil desire occurs, I hate to say the birth of sin is inevitable, but pretty much it is; it’s soon to follow, either in the form of sinful thoughts, sinful words, or sinful behavior. Then we heard that third stage in James 1:15 when he says, “And sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.” The birth of sin occurs, that is that third stage.\\nWe’ve got seduction when we are enticed by our own evil desires, conception when that desire has conceived, and then that conception if you will, gives birth to sin.\\xa0 It’s kind of like the fish and worm illustration; that worm looks real good on that hook, and the fish has no idea until it bites and realizes, “I just got something more than I bargained for.”\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0That’s right. So even that word at the end of James, “That it brings forth death,” that word means “separation.” We die, our body is separated from our immaterial man, our soul, our spirit, and when we think about sin in our body, we begin to see separation, death, and destruction happen all around us as the result and fruit of our sin. We see this stage, and God is trying to warn us to help us to see the end result of falling into temptation. We start to wreck and ruin and disorder our lives as James would talk about later in that passage. Let’s close out with this idea and think about a biblical process for overcoming temptation. How do we take the knowledge that we have learned from the Word, and now put it into practice to fight against this temptation that the evil one lures us with.\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0The Lord explains a three-step process for us all throughout Scripture, and it’s not just for one particular sin, it’s for all sins, for overcoming temptation and sin. It’s known as the “Put off, Put on” principle. That first step is to put off that sinful habit. When this phrase “put off,” it is found in Scripture, it literally means, “to shed” or “take off,” like an old, filthy, and disgusting garment. That’s what God wants us to do with our sin, to put it off to get rid of it, kind of like you need to shed this thing off of your body, like that filthy garment.\\nThis is a really proactive part on our step. Nowhere in Scripture will we find the Lord telling us to just be laid back in the sanctification process. We do not struggle in our sin and then just wait for God to take it from us. We really need to do our part in sanctification because it is a synergistic process. Justification is monergistic, it is done only by God. Glorification, when we go to heaven, that’s monergistic, done only by God. But that dash in the middle on the gravestone that people have referred to, the life we live, is synergistic. It is our obedience coupled with the Holy Spirit helping us.\\xa0 He is the true agent of change, working in conjunction with our obedience to God’s Word.\\nPart of putting off our sin means that we will be prepared for the battle. We need to know ourselves; we need to know our weaknesses like I referred to earlier. Second Corinthians 10:3-5 says, “For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh, for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds; casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ.” I remember when I first started teaching on this at an Annual Conference years ago, it was explained that the phrase, “bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” actually means to wrestle to the ground with the intent of killing. This is not a lazy approach to sin because we’ve got that real enemy. We are to be sober and vigilant like Peter admonished us because the devil walks around seeking to devour us. We need to resist him. We need to be steadfast in the faith, and these are not casual verbs. They are imperatives, which means they’re really active commands.\\nIn order to put off that sin, we not only need to be prepared for battle ahead of time. But we also need to do something that Jesus refers to as radical amputation. We need to cut off immediately, all people, places, things that cause us to sin. Jesus says in Matthew 5:27-30, “You’ve heard that it was said of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ but I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into hell.” We know Jesus is not talking about literal self-mutilation here, but rather radical amputation of the people places and things in our life that make it easier for us to sin.\\nA good modern-day example of this is if anyone saw the movie Fireproof with Kirk Cameron. He’s struggling with pornography throughout the movie, he and his wife are struggling in their relationship, and he has a realization, if you will, from the Lord that the computer is the enticement. He takes that computer out into the driveway and smashes it to pieces with a baseball bat. The theater that I was in erupted into cheers and I thought, “Yes, that’s radical amputation.”\\nOnce we have that understanding of our own sin, because the Holy Spirit has convicted us of it, it’s important that we then confess our sin. We don’t want to just wallow in it. Then we need to take the next step in that biblical process for change after putting it off and confessing it. We need to renew our mind with Scripture, specifically Scripture related to that particular sin by choosing to read God’s Word whether we feel like it or not, and I would actually say to read God’s Word, especially when we don’t feel like it.\\nThen the third and final step in that biblical steps for change is to put on righteousness. The bottom line for that is because sinful habits are not broken, they are replaced. We need to be putting on the opposite of whatever that specific sin is. This is where, if we feel ill equipped, even if we have been walking with the Lord for a long time, it’s so wise to seek biblical counseling, to reach out and say, “I need help. I am really being enticed on a regular basis. I am finding that I am taking the bait on a regular basis and I feel like I am drowning. Can you help me?” Seek that counsel out. There is no shame in needing counsel. Even the wisest men and women I know have sought out counsel, even in the later stages of their walk with the Lord, to just stay humble and teachable. Find somebody that can help you through that and can walk through that process with you.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0We’ve been talking about a lot of really great stuff, and one of the things that I’m hearing you say is that maybe one of our greatest weaknesses is our passivity. We actually act as if we can be passive in relation to our temptation and sin as opposed to attack it based on the Word and pursue righteousness in the way God talks about. As we have been talking about temptation, one of the great resources that I think about often and use often is a book by Kris Lundgard. It’s called The Enemy Within, and he walks through a very similar process that you’re describing here, how to pay attention to temptation, where it comes from, how we understand it, and then how we pursue biblical change in overcoming our temptations from sin.\\nLisa, we’ve been talking about this biblical process of overcoming temptation, and that’s exciting as we think about pursuing how to overcome temptation. One of the things we need to consider is, how do we pursue hope in the midst of this, in the midst of difficulty, as we’re fighting through this challenge of temptation? What are some areas where we can give hope to our counselees as they struggle with temptation?\\nLisa Schmidt:\\xa0This is really important. It’s where the theology aspect of counseling is really important, for people to understand who God is based on who He says He is. One of the main attributes that I personally love about the Lord is that He is faithful. I go back to 1 Corinthians 10:13 where it says, “No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man, but God is faithful,” and then here comes the promise, “He will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able,” even though it doesn’t always feel like that, “but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” It’s really important for our own lives but also for counselees’ lives to notice that nowhere in that verse does it say God will take the temptation away or that He will remove you from the bad circumstance. That’s where the synergistic part of sanctification comes in. God will do His part; we have to do our part by being obedient and making sure we’re not putting ourselves in those difficult situations.\\nThen the second way that we can have hope for future temptations is to respond by doing our part in that sanctification process, by thinking right, when we read and memorize and meditate upon Scripture, by doing right by obeying the Scriptures regardless of how we feel, and then trusting God who promises to make us feel right when we obey Jesus. This is very clear in John 13:17. He says, “If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.” There’s the “think right” when we know these things, we’re meditating on that Scripture, we will be blessed if we do them. The “think right” and the “do right” are our responsibility; the “feel right” is God’s. The word “blessed” in the original language actually means, “to be overflowing with a sense of happiness, or joy and peace.” I don’t know about you Dale, but the two things that counselees tend to be wanting more of in their life is peace and joy, and it comes directly as a result of our thinking rightly according to Scripture and then obeying what those Scriptures say.\\nDale Johnson:\\xa0This has been a great conversation Lisa, and I am so grateful that you have been with us.

      "{'title': 'Is It a Sin to Be Tempted?', 'subtitle': 'Truth in Love 166', 'author': 'Heath Lambert', 'category': 'Typical Issues', 'subcategory': 'Temptation 6', 'question': \"Learn about the Bible's teaching on temptation.\", 'body': 'This week on the podcast, we are answering a crucial question: Are our temptations sinful? Is it sinful to be tempted? This is a crucial question for us to answer on the podcast because there is really a debate raging in larger evangelicalism about whether that’s the case or not, particularly as it relates to the issue of homosexuality. The debate is, is it wrong merely to commit homosexual acts, or to be tempted to commit homosexual acts? The reason this is so important is because there are some people who want to argue for a homosexual orientation that want to put this orientation in the category of “temptation” and say that the presence of a homosexual desire is not a sin, but is a temptation. Since it’s a temptation, it’s not a sin and therefore not wrong.\\xa0\\nAnother reason why this is such a crucial question for us to answer does not have anything to do with what’s raging out there in an evangelical debate, but with what’s raging in our own hearts. I have talked with I don’t even know how many people just in the last week in the context of doing my ministry that are wondering about what’s going on in their own lives when they are tempted by something. It could be homosexuality, it could be general sexual desire, or it could be anything else. They wonder, “When I am tempted, do I need to repent?” So this is an issue that has implications for the larger conversations that evangelicals are having, and it’s a conversation that has an impact on the lives we’re living as we walk before the face of God.\\xa0So we want to talk about whether it is a sin to be tempted.\\xa0\\nTo answer the question, I want to look at Hebrews 4:15. There, the Bible says that “we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who’s been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.” Now, this text reminds us to have a level of sophistication here in our thinking, and it tells us that there is some temptation that is sinful and some temptation that is not sinful. The Bible is very clear that Jesus was tempted in all ways as we are, and yet he did it without sins. So Hebrews 4:15 makes it clear that there are some temptations that you can have that will not be sinful. The reason we know that is because that was the experience of Jesus Christ.\\xa0\\nSo the question is, how can we tell whether a temptation is sinful or whether a temptation is not sinful as in the experience of Jesus. I would encourage us to compare Hebrews 4:15 with James 1:14-15. It says each one is tempted when he’s carried away and enticed by his own lust or his own desire, and then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. So here, James, the brother of Jesus, is talking about a kind of lust, a kind of desire, that is bad. It terminates in sin and death, and what he says is that kind of temptation is linked with desire.\\xa0\\nTo really understand this in its fullest sense, we need to talk about then two kinds of temptation. There is external temptation and there is internal temptation. External temptation is the kind of temptation that is outside of us, so we could say that if an immodest woman walked by a man or if an immodest man walked by a woman, there is a certain external kind of temptation. There is the opportunity to be led astray by this thing outside of you, you know, if you walk into an office and there is a million dollars in cash sitting on the table. That is an external temptation; that is, there is an opportunity outside of you that is presenting you with the availability of sin.\\xa0So there is the external kind of temptation.\\xa0\\nThis is the kind of temptation that Jesus Christ would have experienced in his life on earth. There was the devil saying, “Hey, why don’t you take this stone and turn it into bread? I mean, you are hungry after all. Here, why don’t you throw yourself down from this building? God’s gonna have your back. I mean, come on.” So there is this external presentation of an opportunity to sin.\\xa0\\nBut then there is an internal temptation. There is the heart that is greedy, the heart that desires, and once those external realities latches onto them, or to use the language of James 1, hooks onto those external realities, our sinful hearts are characterized by sinful desire. And that is full of hooks that latch onto the external temptations. Jesus was tempted in every way we are in the external sense, but he did it without sinning because his heart was not sinful, and so had no hooks to cling onto the external presentations for sin.\\xa0So we can say that temptation does not have to be sinful in the external sense, but temptation will be sinful when it is matched with an internal desire to sin. It is the corruption of a fallen human heart, therefore, that internalizes temptation, and internalized temptation matched with a desire to sin will constitute a sinful temptation.\\xa0\\nWhen you think about this internal desire now, you don’t even need an external temptation. A person who is internally tempted to sin doesn’t need the immodest woman or the immodest man to walk by, they can conjure up that sinful image in their mind. Even in the absence of an external temptation, there is an internal temptation that is itself sinful.\\xa0\\nThe question is, is it a sin to be tempted? The answer is, it depends if you have an external temptation that presents itself to you and you immediately flee to Jesus Christ. You have a heart that does not hook onto that temptation in any way. Then you were really and meaningfully tempted in the same way that Jesus was in Matthew 4, for example, but it was not a sin. It did not latch onto any hook in your heart. On the other hand, as soon as we begin to desire things that are not good, then we would have to say in that sense, the temptation has become internal. It’s met with a desire in our heart that hooks onto something that’s either outside of us or purely internal in our minds, and we have sinned.\\xa0\\nThe good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ is, whether there is external temptation or whether there is internal temptation, Jesus Christ gives us His grace to escape it. He pays for it when we sin with our temptation, and in His resurrection power, He gives us the ability to turn away from temptation and to live a life that is holy and pleasing to Him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                      Apple Podcasts                    \\n\\nTopics:\\nTemptation\\xa0\\n                                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHeath Lambert is the Senior Pastor at First Baptist Church, Jacksonville and former Executive Director of ACBC.', 'source': 'https://biblicalcounseling.com/resource-library/topic-index/'}\n"
